I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack
of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,
I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end
to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they
are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why
he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot
fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of
fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final
regular season game.          PENS RULE!!!

Think!

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
psychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and
memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond
refresh rates common.

So your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were
probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.

[stuff deleted]

Ok, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able
to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), 
BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if
each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd
consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).

I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE
and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two
afternoon games.

Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed
to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore
and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.

This will be a hard task, because most cultures used most animals

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. [Honestly.]
The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]


Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands
of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the
Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much
differently than had one applied them within the confines of
their original expression.

I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior 
of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit
from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes
to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.
I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely
he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order 
for many years.

Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back
so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is
only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed
which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there
was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order
itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.


Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....

"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist
and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo
Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  
Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz
Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together
prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902
in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,
Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of
the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught
secret of sexual magic.
 
"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in
Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and
possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist
League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was
later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden
Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to
found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several
attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the
development of the O.T.O.

"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.
For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin
and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between
Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and
accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,
the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for
the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all
the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked
when publishing the material of the Equinox.

"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a
stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when
_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break
in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.
over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.
He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply
infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation."

_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'

Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by 
  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,
    Caliph of the United States of America,
      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.



There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this
material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?
Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own
organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle
of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very
complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room
for very many interpretations.

It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived
out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters
with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I
can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble
support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.

Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  
Will I?  
I think not.
Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection
I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things
in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be
quite difficult to apprehend at first.

So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.
I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess
them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of
the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then
what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that
the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or
does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of
universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic
requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?


I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.
They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane
or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  
Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or
were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity
of the organization as it stands.

I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments 
I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting
a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating
in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic
Mass well enough for my tastes.
 

This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.
I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my
limited contact with other members.

I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many
ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with
the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom
and the preservation of individual vision.

I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response
to other posts in this thread.

Many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive I have

I now have some information on how to modify this for use with a BBC B 
computer. Not only do you have to change the speed from 600 to 300 rpm
(tried that) but also change 8 components in the Rec/Play section to allow
for the lower data rate (250kbit, not 500kbit as it was designed for) and also
change the Recording Current to allow for the low data rate/rev speed!

Hopefully this should sort it all out .... not bad for 9 quid (normally 32 
quid and upwards ....)

I, some years ago, almost became a victim of this.  Squirted a fair amount in
an old model 15 Teletype which was acting up, then turned it on.  The eruption
when the motor starting contacts broke was mighty spectacular... I almost got
my eyebrows singed, the plastic (old ones had safety glass) cover over the
platen, etc flew across the room, and several people in the room almost had
heart attacks.  Beware the explosive properties of WD40 vapor.

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that
"the people" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and
have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.

I quote:

  "... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in
  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the
  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the
  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people
  to keep and bear Arms ...."
	- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).

Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution
for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not
presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the
government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that
the amendment protected the individual right to possess military
weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully
gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the
interpretation.

Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:

 "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,
  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major
  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-
  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right
  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."
   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,
     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )

You might rightfully ask "well then, what does that first bit about
militias mean?"

Well, "militia" in historical context basically means the whole of the
adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines
"militia" as all armed men over the age of 17).

   "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting
    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were
    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of
    the kind in common use at the time."
	- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).

The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale
behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to
bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military
power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the
government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than
the other way around.

   "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason
   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last
   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."
     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776
       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).

   "And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of
   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be
   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in
       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).

   "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;
   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme
   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;
   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute
   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on
   any pretense, raised in the United States."
     - Noah Webster, "An Examination into the Leading Principles
       of the Federal Constitution" (1787), in Pamphlets on the
       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).

You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be
repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it
doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have
changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine
it away.

I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.

However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get
it out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in
talk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with
you.

Me too, though unfortunately the "Official Line" is the one that you
have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. The examiner's
guidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider education
courses have no choice but to follow them. It surprises me that none of the
rider groups here, either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that
the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
in order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, that
you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just
when it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which I can't
think of for the moment. If the riding test could be rejigged a bit 
to include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the 
woefully simplistic crap that it contains now, then the accident figures
would (imho) reduce still further.

Don't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though...

: So many newsgroups, so little time!


I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last
May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes
the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet
must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed
manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my
truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts
rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet 
says that the noise is "a characteristic of the transmission."

Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the
gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about
55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,
the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should
point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a
detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They
dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for "engine longevity"
reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.
Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times 
so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being
shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between
stabilizer and control arm fell off).

Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What
really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt
to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for 
them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new
Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never
buy another Chevrolet.

Write your own wm that doesn't support the ICCCM.  Or write an program that you give a window ID and a title.  The your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it, your program switches it back again.

I've only ever done it in an automatic. I was sitting in my Olds, in
the winter, at a light, when I heard screeching behind me. I managed to
dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half
where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was. I've never
had occasion to do it on a bike, but I imagine that it would be even
easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. Giving a gander
at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch
out smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the
screeching.

I don't know the exact coverage in the states.  In Canada it is covered
by TSN, so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage!  I don't know!

As for the picks
Ottawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will 
go #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would
take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships.  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.

San Jose will then get Kariya.

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov (I think that's it) or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)

Because of expansion I won't go further but I will name other of the
blue chip prospects

   - Chris Gratton
   - Chris Pridham
   - a swedish player who I can't remember his name

Draft Order
-----------
1) Ottawa
2) San Jose
3) Tampa Bay
4) South Florida or Anahiem
5) South Florida or Anahiem
6) Hartford
7) Edmonton
8) Dallas
9) NY Rangers
10) Philadelphia

the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - I don't have the standings here
and am guessing 

(In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with Kariya 
 leading the way but not going #1)

Tough call without more investigation, but if the thermal imaging story
holds up, I think the government will be more credable... of course,
paranoia fans won't believe their results anyway, will they?

Hear, hear! I'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports
that multiple victims were found shot (in the head), and in positions
inconsistent with fire victims. It is simply too early to draw conclusions
either way about this nasty incident, but I tend to believe the government
side.

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you
phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of "right"
and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is
legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).

Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives
of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.
One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,
veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little
sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can
certainly ask that question about motives.

Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.

Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with
the first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a
meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is
irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that
one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make
value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"
of the position.

Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,
neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold
different moral values (feelings).

    Would you believe that there is a letter in MacWEEK this week from
one of the hardware types at Digital Eclipse. He says that they run
tests on all of the components to see if they will perform at the
upgraded speed. If they do not then DESI replaces them with ones that

We heard about this from a newspaper article.  Journalists and editors
always pick out the most interesting and sensational "facts" for our
delectation.  As the editor of the Sun once said: "We never let the
facts get in the way of a good story".  You must have noticed how
motorcyclists get treated by the press.  They thrive on hysteria,
ignorance, sensationalism and one-upmanship.  Unfortunately there's
not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of.

Well, suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was
sent towards a black hole.  As it got closer to the event horizon, the
red shift would keep increasing.  The period would get longer and longer,
but it would never stop.  An observer would not observe the probe actually
reaching the event horizon.  The detected energy from the probe would keep
decreasing, but it wouldn't vanish.  Exp(-t) never quite reaches zero.

I guess the above probably doesn't make things any more clear, but hopefully
you will get the general idea maybe.

Oh dear, time for me to try to remember my chemistry.  Let's see if I
can find the formulae somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind.
<sounds of gears>  <fumes of overheated oil>  <unmistakable stench of
the Nasal Chromatograph>   Ha!  I knew there was a double bond!  Now
how shall I show that in ASCII? 

          MEK:                                 Acetone:

          C - C - C - C                        C - C - C
              #                                    #
              O                                    O

The hydrogens are not shown, and # represents double bond.  MEK has a
methyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other.  Acetone
has two methyls.  So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead
is dimethyl ketone.  Both solvents have similar properties.  I think
that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe.
It's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was.  Use acetone.

Nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone.  If you buy
some for your workshop, get the very cheapest, because the more
expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you don't need.

I know for a fact that the EISA version of the Orchid ProDesigner IIS
works.  However, an EISA SVGA card is likely a waste of money.

When XFree86 2.0 comes out, with support for accelerated chipsets, ISA,
EISA, and VLB will all be supported.

The more important question is "what chipsets are supported?".  The bus
is basically irrelevent as a compatibility issue.

You're blowing smoke.  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas
markets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them "don't do encryption
if you ever hope to export this technology".  The reason that CDMA doesn't
have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door.
It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular
is big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations all over again.

If you don't believe me, call Qualcomm and ASK THEM.  Don't just throw
out conspicracy theories.  At least, don't do it on sci.crypt--there are
whole other newsgroups devoted to this kind of uninformed claptrap.

Hah.  They're not that much more expensive.  Besides, if a drug dealer

No, Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different
stuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm isn't.  So Cylink makes
money--that's capitalism, comrade.

WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1%, you 
need a trimmer or to screen devices, it can't be made from adding 2 
resitors of 1% value in parallel, since the smaller device will have the 
error of 1% to cope with. 
You have 3 choices;
a) live with the error of 1% tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low 
sensitivity designs
b) buy resistors with better than 1% tolerance (Vishay/Dale)
c) use trimmers or SOT's (Select-On-Test)

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.
How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget
allows, the Land Cruiser? 
Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.
Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance
when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually
make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the
on-road comfort.

Don't worry about this -- they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do
  make a claim. They'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end
  when they leave you in the lurch.

>>>I've read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar

More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals 
  showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I
  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a
  and some local governments.
The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can
  tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make
  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most
  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but 
  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called
  extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost
  universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an
  increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you
  a riskier driver to insure.
Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!

Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go
with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer
discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as
commission. That's another story for another day.

Oh, Bobby. You're priceless. Did I ever tell you that?

My policy with Bobby's posts, should anyone give a damn, is to flick
through the thread at high speed, searching for posts of Bobby's which
have generated a whole pile of followups, then go in and extract the
hilarious quote inevitably present for .sig purposes. Works for me.

For the guy who said he's just arrived, and asked whether Bobby's for real,
you betcha. Welcome to alt.atheism, and rest assured that it gets worse.
I have a few pearls of wisdom from Bobby which I reproduce below. Is anyone
(Keith?) keeping a big file of such stuff?

     "In Allah's infinite wisdom, the universe was created from nothing,
        just by saying "Be", and it became. Therefore Allah exists."
           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #1

     "Wait. You just said that humans are rarely reasonable. Doesn't that
      contradict atheism, where everything is explained through logic and
      reason? This is THE contradiction in atheism that proves it false."
           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #2

              "Plus, to the believer, it would be contradictory
                    to the Quran for Allah not to exist."
           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #3

and now

   "One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that say "Mom",
    because of the love of their mom. It makes for more virile men. Compare
    that with how homos are raised.  Do a study and you will get my point."

Not in a clock-doubled system. There isn't a doubling in performance, but
it _is_ quite significant. Maybe about a 70% increase in performance.

Besides, for 0 wait state performance, you'd need a cache anyway. I mean,
who uses a processor that runs at the speed of 80ns SIMMs? Note that this
memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 12.5 MHz.

A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable
locks under the Kryptonite name.

When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite 
U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for
a new lock for the bicycle.

For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock
(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,
Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).
I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in
disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.

First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by
the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of
quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable
lock with the Kryptonite name on it.

Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I
don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often
quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes
it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.

Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves
the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the 
dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the 
lock mechanism would stand up to an "insert screwdriver and TORQUE"
attack.

Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to 
deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the
weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient
you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go 
through the cable in well under a minute.

I don't buy this at all.  I think things are colored to a very large
degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are.  Try
this exercise:

XXX is pitching today.  His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3
in the fourth.  XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th.  In the fifth,
he gives up 3 runs.  In the 6th, he gives up 2 more.  The score is now
7-5, with XXX's team still on top.

I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be "he is
a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win."

If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be "he is an
inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch.  Needs more
seasoning.  Send him to AAA.  Or to the spice rack."

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more
sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't
be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds
to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to
the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting
empty. Before it gets empty.

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even
under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with
interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V
documentation.

You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of
your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if
you have problems with sounds working when you play one per
channel and then close the channel (with the related
slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't
work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a
channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be
because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with
a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to
the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds
have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit
the sound and remove that command, then when you create your
channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the
channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you
want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you
are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.

Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the
sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses
it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you
can too.

One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the
Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not
sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your
sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the
Sound Manager.

I don't know about classified, but I do seem to remember that unless

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm
hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various
switches and jumbers are used for.

Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although
I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected
to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding
connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector
with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and
7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that
SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of
the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]
are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.
	     
The only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD"
across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.
Immediately below the words "SERIAL NO", but not in the box left for
the S/N, are the numbers "1990 2 8".

Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated.

Convenient?  It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to
alt.conspiracy.

Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'
measurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than the
more common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at
least 2 misconceptions:

1.  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.
    Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are
    iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun
    were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel
    parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be
    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.

2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and
    'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.   So the
    weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to
    imply.  And, even if it was, so what?  It would not have melted
    anyway.

The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly
descended from the NACA, with space added in.

You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the
X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one
dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't
change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity
of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s
have sweep wings.

>Winglets.  Area ruling.  Digital fly by wire.  Ride smoothing.

Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...

After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams
demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley
Research Center, were giants in the field.

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we
used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but
that had more to do with availability and need than with military
involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was
bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our
results and supportive of our efforts.

Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No
mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were.
General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how
successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both
fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)

Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!  

The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other
hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
can't do.

Why not? I believe both the Devils and Islanders got 87 points.
Say for example, another team had this record : 20-37-47;
they had 20*2+47*1+37*0=87 which is the same as their points total.
(The Islanders' and Devils' records are both 40-37-7.

It is simple arithmetics and involve no Calculus.

  Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job. But
   what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid
   baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores
   to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and 
   football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid
   basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that
   was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during
   the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..

   I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN. Hope things improve
   by next season...

Yes some radar detectors are less detectable by radar detector

wrong!  the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes, while the ES300 uses a

People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the
things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to
consider reasonable alternatives.

However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's
no longer necessary to be an "independent thinker" to depart from the
government's party line.  It looks like our "independent press" may 
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is
a good sign.  I hope it continues.

Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one
set of facts are being presented, "coming to a conclusion" is not the 
hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability
to challenge those "facts" critically.  The scientific method consists
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed.

SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL
 
    By Laura Pitter
    TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist
when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim
town of Srebrenica last August.
    But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody
war, he considers himself a surgeon.
    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no
license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives
normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''
    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,
the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of
the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the
suffering of the thousands trapped there.
    ``I lived through hell together with the people of
Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest
heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.
    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant
at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he
had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says
he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for
guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without
anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean
sections.
    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the
first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000
patients.
    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from
Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people
carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him
through guerrilla terrain, he said.
    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells
landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football
field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of
the dead were women and children.
    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the
children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the
blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.
    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not
piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her
hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no
heads.''
    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were
deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had
the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.
    The six general practitioners who had been operating before
he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They
didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''
    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by
mid-September he had run out of supplies.
    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes
they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no
anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain
because it increased bleeding.
    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and
stomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were
impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.
    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.
    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived
from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.
    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in
mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the
region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''
    Then the hunger set in.
    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began
air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day
from complications associated with malnutrition, he said.
    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the
people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.
    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in
Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.
    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after
visiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.
    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of
people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when
I left. And I cried too.''

First of all, "ceremonial law" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes
used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions,
without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be 
a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.

Paul writes in Collosions 2:14-17 how that Christ nailed the laws that were
against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what
what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days,
or the keeping of the sabbath.

The word for sabbath in this verse is "sabbaton" and is used throughout the
New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from
which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the
sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.

If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption "the sabbath cannot
be a ceremonial law" then he will have to find some way around it, like
saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the
7tH day, Because "the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law."  But
Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal 
statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin
in his writings.

Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which
talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have
been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society
that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were
slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath
if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?

  A weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day

                       Startext: MC344578

                   -= THIS WEEK'S THOUGHTS =-

Last week the Supreme Court refused without comment to hear an
appeal by Rensselaer, IN, school officials desiring the
distribution of Bibles in their public schools (REL65, 5/21). A
lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-
distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The
ACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action
protected the "religious neutrality of our public schools." He also
said that schools must serve students of "all faiths and none."
Schools were not to be a "bazaar where rival religious groups
compete for converts," according to Lynn.

Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in
hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of
similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on
sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.
They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their
children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to
continue their work at a distance, but find the school's position
somewhat disheartening.

I understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I
can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other
hand, when does "neutrality" become "nihilism?" When does plurality
turn into no position at all?

I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms
but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.

The other is that while we are seeking "religious neutrality" in
our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced
"religious neutrality" for the past seventy years--are making the 
Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.
Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100
public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had
requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is
president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly
invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the
students and are given class time to explain its contents. I
remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and
speaking to the university students standing under a statue of
Lenin. Now, that's ironic!

I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths
have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To
allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like
atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions
and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality
of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public
arena acknowledges it as valid.

However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the
distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our
schools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a
singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make
moral and ethical decisions.

What do you think?

John,

I agree that the "home" ain't what it used to be, and some homes
are NOT the place to learn value-based sexuality. I still believe
that this is where the church can come into play. I know, those
families you speak of may not come to a church to seek information,
but the help does not need to be in a church building...I believe
that the youth from the families you mentioned will probably
disregard the value-free information at school, too.

"The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time
 against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been 
 confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by
 Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that
 these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States
 delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came 
 to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, 
 their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation
 was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed
 by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns
 before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped
 that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of 
 February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region
 of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According
 to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the
 aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,
 many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women
 have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who
 were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the
 mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity 
 and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the
 Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order 
 to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities 
 committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims
 be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,
 and honour of the Muslims be protected."

[discussing the use of IRQ 7]

In  recent article msprague@superior.mcwbst311b (Mike Sprague) writes:

>I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
>(I can't prove it's true, but I believe it), LPT1 does not

To put it a little differently:

 - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.

 - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's
   time to send out another byte to the printer.

 - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the
   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it
   in the high-impedence mode.

 - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines
   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't
   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes
   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper.

   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold
   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and
   that certainly isn't a requirement.)

 - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the
   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance
   reasons.  

And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.

Hi.  My last question for the year.  I have a mail-order no-name notebook
with 4 meg ram.  I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when
running desqview, but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me, most
commonly citing a "memory parity error."  The only thing I can do is TURN
OFF and re-boot.  My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup,
and there is never a problem with this either.

Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware?  I remember
having some disk error problems when installing it.


Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of
this happening (I think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but both
crash frequently nonetheless)

I know this is a pain, but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home account
doesn't have rn.  And I will stop asking questions now.  Thank you.

Just a thought on resources,  It is very important if you do use a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources.  I have
used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource
converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially
the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.
With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance,
this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK,
and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So 
your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the
proper resource identifier.
I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does
use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to
port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel
for anything )

In the same way in which antisemite means anti-Jewish and not anti-all-

Jobs?  What the hell have jobs to do with it?  It's another touchy-feely 
program from the new, vapid administration.  The fact is, the major claim
made for "universal" immunization -- that "all children will be immunized" --
has absolutely no validity.  Several states already have U.I. programs, have
had these programs for _years_. The result: on average, their success rates
are no better than the national average.  It seems that the gummint hasn't

of shameless demagoguery from the "new" Democrats, the "agents of change."

Well, there *is* a difference.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general
_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'
curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a
room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 
5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.

Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold
place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.

Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.
As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating
temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).

In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember
that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or
something.

Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized
oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,
thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, 
but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  

If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine
(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,
stick to the 10W40.

"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be
Impossible"

Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the
headline shown above. The article starts with "A leader
of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned
space station said yesterday the job is tough and may
be impossible." O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is
possible to cut costs that much and still provide for
meaningful research "is a real question for me."
O'Connor said "everything is fair game," including
"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the
aerospace industry, chopping management of the space
station program at some NASA facilities around the
country, working closely with the Russian space station
Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the
manned space shuttle fleet."

O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options
so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates
into three categories based on cost.

The Post says O'Connor described the design derived
from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe
Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I
listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press
on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor
talked about how the White House wants three options,
sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part
of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has
formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,
modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch
Core ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to
a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say
the option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"
cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not
the "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).

The article goes on to describe the other two options
as "one features modules that could gradually be fitted
together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The
other is a core facility that could be deposited in
orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option
would use existing hardware from the space shuttle -
the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."

The last sentence in the article contradicts the title
& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He
[O'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned
space station Freedom is still possible within the
administration's budget guidelines."

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

Currently, my solution is:

	XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetWMProperties(..);
	XMapWindow(...);
	XFlush(...);
	XMoveWindow(...);


It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious.

If a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky.
Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? 
Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, 
drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well,
anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the 
Nazis.

 "Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously
  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,
  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and 
  anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient."[1]

[1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,' 
    Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.
  
As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) 
was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in
Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but 
had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally
Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect
of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian
who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.
In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central
Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the 
American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local
Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20
chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters
and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.
Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:

 "The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.
  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first."[1]

Now wait, there is more.

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about
600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.

The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000
dead.

The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a
15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  "Hojali
Disaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more
than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "We  did  not count  the
bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy," Mr
Zen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead."

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre. "Don't  get worked up.  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-old
lawyer said at his small office.

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 1990.

Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70
miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.

Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department. "This  is just a small percentage
of the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic
scientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within 24 hours."

Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14
years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's
report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six
policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the
names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The
most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27
February.

"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream
and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village," Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot.

"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and
one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return."

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces.

May 13, 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_
 
MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in
Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for
allegedly "carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers." 

A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey
said "the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal," the 
Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported. 

But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed
over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. 

"This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have
committed crimes," the statement reads. 

The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison
sentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar
district of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. 

The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a
company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which
they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to 
carry out diversions against Azeri troops. 

However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the
Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in
the battle zone round Karabakh. 

Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for
five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has
left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. 

Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed
in these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the 
Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. 

The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the
Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the
six men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. 

It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request 
to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense
attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.

I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If
that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify
or refute this?

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did 
Alomar have?  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs,
Gwynn, and the other magicians.  So less attention was given to Sandberg. 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the

This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in
the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I
found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the
same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's
the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron
(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB
motherboard.

I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that
Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never
heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because
my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines
and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better
warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have
recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should
trust the company.

I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the
clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about
either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I
go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.

Thanks very much in advance for any information.

The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution.
PbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  Also, H2SO4
is in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of
PbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.

As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).
(More about this later.)

What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:
(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)
The battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things
happen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead
           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).
        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution
           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).
Now, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate
in a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)
we end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4
forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this
happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).

The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If
there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate
(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.

I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they
are for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore
the lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with
these products for a newer battery.

This stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid.
In fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher
temperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this:
"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to
 -50 to 'pull' the reaction along."  We all know from experience (at
 least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is
not true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm
the battery.

(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge
 to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any
 such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This
 is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool
 during storage.)

Just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!

I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows.
Specifically, I am working on an application that generates formatted reports.
Since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is:

1.  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
Visual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit?

As I have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get
around the above problem, I am working on the following approach:

I am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word, using the
WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic(VB) and load
this template of mine, which will work in the following way:

It will first open MyOwn.INI file (created in VB - at the time when the
user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the
.INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file.

1.  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way
to specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file?

2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to
read more than the 32k at one time?

Any help will be appreciated.

Actually, I think J. Chiu knows the score and is just being
silly. However, "decibel" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is
right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.

Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,
and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,
hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).

The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are
all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine
way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.
Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,
but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him
until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)
All the other units were defined many decades earlier.

The switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to 1k ohm when

How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty
good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the
deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the 
Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they 
lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping
Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for
the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).

BusLogic just announced the BT445 FAST SCSI-2 VLB Interface as of
April 20.  This always happens to me!

I have a one week old BT545S which is the ISA version.  I am
enjoying spectacular performance with a Micropolis MC2105 560mb 10ms
3.5" HH 5200 RPM drive.  I'll be changing to the BT445 VERY soon,
though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with
the 32bit VESA support.

You can call BusLogic and ask 'em about the NT question. I hear that
the support is excellent.   I have not had to call them myself yet.

Well, I thought that highmem.sys would do that too. I just took out emm386  
of my config.sys, and I'm still loading my other drivers high (mouse, vga  
shadow bios, dos-key etc.) I haven't checked mem/c, but I believe I have  
managed to load them high (ie between 640KB and 1024KB).

Also, ever since I took out emm386, windows loads slightly faster, I get  
about 3 extra meg of freemem in windows (I'm running 386 enhanced with 4  
Meg RAM, 7 Meg swap) and I got rid of my ctrl-alt del reboot problem  
(before, the computer would not reboot using ctrl-alt-del after exiting  
windows). 

I would really like to keep emm386 out of my config.sys. Anybody else have  
info on this???

Are the Moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into

People die for lies all the time.

Was Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan? We spend
millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the
answer is no, they wouldn't be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied
about some things.

Why do you think he healed people, because the Bible says so? But if God
doesn't exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely
inspired and one can't use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by
unbiased observers.

Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in
order to fulfil these prophecies), possibly selective diting on behalf of
those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the
general; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such
riddles (like Nostradamus) that anything that happens can be twisted to fit
the words of raving fictional 'prophecy'.

I'm very pleased with the output (remember that I'm used to imagens,

to be careful to let it dry before touching it, as it will smudge.

The deskjet is SLOW.  This is in comparison to the other printers I

The interface between Win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, I've not
had any problems with it.

is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
"No Big Deal". Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort

We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started
on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully
started we run an xterm as the "console" - the problem is that any messages
that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  "Refresh window" fails
to remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of
the screen obscuring anything else below them.

At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.
We're running X in color, and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are
on the B/W framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.

My question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid
of these messages?

The law is much worse than worthless.  It gives police the power to put
innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't
understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the
difference between a core file and classified military secrets.

There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something
is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the
user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No
one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.

What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to
provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester
or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most
people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.

As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they
insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came
from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it
in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.

As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is,
without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random
bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is
pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.

If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data,
because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to
look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If
enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.

When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's
just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're
sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will
burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.

IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA,
and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to

You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The
hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has   
nothing to do with SCSI.

And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.

Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS/2 type OS do all the miraculous things
with an IDE harddrive that it can with a (single) SCSI hard drive.

A similar reason is why people at work, used to seeing SCO unix running

68020/68881.  The Sun was designed from the ground up for UNIX, the PC
wasn't.

This is why you need a gargantuan processor to run Windows.  The basic
design of the box is all wrong. (Would've been better if MS had put most
of Windows on a plug-in ROM card from day one. (priced at $24.95 or
so...) People woulda loved it.

Apple had the right idea, just stumbled a bit in the execution.

Hi Everyone ::

I am  looking for  some software  called SHADOW as

Now we have  an  old  version of the  program here
,but unfortunately we don't have any documentation
if anyone knows  where I  can  get  some  docs, or
maybe  a  newer  version  of  the program or  even 
another  program that does the same sort of  thing
I would love to hear from you.

PS I think SHADOW was written by a F Cerrina?

Anyone any ideas?

Actually, an apostle is someone who is sent.  If you will, mailmen could
be called apostles in that sense.  However, with Jesus, they were
designated and were given power.  Remember that there were many
thousands of people who witnessed what Jesus did.  That didn't make them
apostles, though.

A lot of the time, when you're dealing with someone who has no financial  
interest in selling you the machine, you get a lot of opinion (as opposed  
to factual information, etc.).  What it sounds like to me is that this guy  
has had an experience with one flaky Centris 610 and formed an  
all-encompassing opinion on the rest of the 610's.  I've seen lots of  
people who frustrated me to no end because they refused to believe any

Sure about that? Maybe Proxima might cause problems, but at Oort

Besides, even the solar system's Oort cloud is unstable over

Until we're able to perform a broad-band survey of nearby stars
to detect planets, we won't know enough to say whether or not
a single star has planets. And we're likely to find out about the
close ones first.

Heck, if neutron stars can have planets, anything can have planets.
(Or was that discovery disconfirmed?)

All of those things that you've mention can still be accomplished
when the
machine is "power down."  When the previous poster said "power
down", it 
doesn't mean turning off the machine, it just means that the machine
is
in an energy conserving mode that sucks up least electricity.

    But no one (or at least, not many people) are trying to pass off God
as a scientific fact.  Not so with Kirlian photography.  I'll admit that
it is possible that some superior intelligence exists elsewhere, and if

it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module

Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing
Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in
the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have
another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville 
before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up
in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the 
majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he 
became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation 
as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to
hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--

Born 31 July 1962
Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA  
1988    195    .282    .320    .328
1990    220    .277    .373    .321
1991    459    .264    .351    .317
1992    485    .249    .359    .290 

No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28, 
now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince,
given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not
a rosy picture.

BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation 
coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was
a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter
and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter
as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a
philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything
evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity -
man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing
that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all
who consider themselves "christians" are (even those who manage to head
their own "churches").  "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will
enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who
is in heaven." - Matt. 7:21.

Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you
into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving
you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:
1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain
it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this
salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain
modern offshoots like the "new age movement" teach or does he require God's

Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a
conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You
wrote that "I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most
of the teachings of christ".  Well, Christ referred to God as "My Father",
not "My Mother", and while the "maleness" of God is not the same as the
maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not
honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,
or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent
to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - 
english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God
chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human
population.

Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of
the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the
last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this
article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I
may have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of
mind, something to contemplate.

  Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds

  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency
  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel
  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato
  Institute points out.

    According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,
  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10
  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of
  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as
  dramatically.

    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial
  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy
  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group
  of Seven nations.

    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil
  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the
  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,
  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the
  overall U.S. economy.

    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per
  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.

    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side
  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource
  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not
  reduce demand.

    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes
  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that
  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,
  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood
  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state
  at the expense of the individual.

    "Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion" is no.

                        The Cato Institute

    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research
  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate
  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the
  traditional American principles of limited government, individual
  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve
  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in 
  questions of policy and the proper role of government.
    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets
  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th
  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation
  of the American Revolution.
    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually
  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive
  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary
  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for
  civil liberties.
    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive
  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy
  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned
  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military
  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy
  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are
  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.
    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts
  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,
  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from
  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,
  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue
  Code.

        Since I'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, I'm 
asking for help.  I know better than to hook a 12v, 1a stepper line to

        Also, I've looked into the TIPC2701N by TI, and I was wondering 
if I should use the same suggested (by you replying to this message)

I was wondering if anyone might have some schematic or at least some

Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I

I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.
What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.

>Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself.

Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain 
knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the
Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and
there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond
our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  
to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a
person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find 
something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one
will gain with that attitude is folly.

Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages
in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even
though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.
Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such
deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. 
I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, "You will never
be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over."


From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):

    "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
     to search out a matter is the glory of kings."


Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:

   "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."


And in John 3:16:

   "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
   life."


You are included in "whosoever".  And I also pray that the Father is
drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting
to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the
making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure
stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became
on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.

You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because
you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack
Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,
proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.

Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would 
probably say to you: "Satan would surely like to have you."  Why so?
Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great
moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task
he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the
faith to walk on water as Jesus did.

You asked "Why not believe in Zeus?"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.
You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.

Via K_P, of course.  Nothing was said about where K_P comes from.  It's
the session key, though, and it's chosen however you usually choose
session keys --- exponential key exchange, shared secret, RSA, etc.
But however you choose it, the chip will apparently emit the escrow

First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing
people.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on
whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed
punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus

You asked for it.

2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.
Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in
God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.
2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the
disciples "will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out
from the presence of the Lord".
2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth
being condemned.
Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes
and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in
the "fiery lake of burning sulfur".
Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast
"will be tormented with burning sulfur" and there being "no rest day or
night" for them because of it.
Psalm 9:17:  "The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that
forget God."

I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.

[In the following I'm mostly playing "devil's advocate".  I'm not
advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that
it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible
to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often
uses the term "second death".  The most obvious understanding of that
would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks
both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms
that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince
you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that
there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to
understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary
point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,
whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35
implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably
they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to 
understand this passage in a non-literal way.)

2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them
in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.

Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire
prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is
eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.
Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been
prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the
eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet
will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being
thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as "the second death".
This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible
that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as
the devil, and humans?

2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is "everlasting destruction"?
This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be
understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think
that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction
that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in
eternity.

2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.
Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above
Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,
it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says
that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that 
there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people
are tormented forever.

Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.

It is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in
their signatures (I failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your
posting). Not only because it is the polite thing to do, but also to avoid
addressing ladies with "Mr.", as you have done.

Secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as Cyprus has
never been Greek, but rather, it has been home to a bi-communal society formed
of Greeks and Turks. It seems that you know as little about the history and
the demography of the island, as you know about the essence of Turkey's 
military intervention to it under international agreements.

Be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what
is going on today on Azerbaijani land, can only be drawn with the expansionist
policy that Armenia is now pursuing.

But, I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political
conduct of countries, and promulgate them in such terminology as
"itchy-bitchy"...

Subject: Anybody out there?
Organization: Grass Valley Group, Grass Valley, CA
Lines: 30

I seldom see any posts in this group. Is anyone out there in Christendom
listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?

Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends
home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent
something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a
national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made
to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is
working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article
included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in
preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the
specifications given in the Bible. 

What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are
complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli
government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the
very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is
unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that
the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding
impossible without sparking a holy war. 

Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming
sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.
Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think
it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it
happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is
drawing near. Look up!

  Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in

though, so I can't find the exact location :)

  WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling
noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an X window id from it
anyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying
to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's

One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark

You wanna do masking. Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
you name "opaque" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this
bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to
adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.

The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog
mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.

But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS...

Hey, man, you brought it up.  I agree completely, driving drunk is really
stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But
DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as 
motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly.

In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,
but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto,
admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.

	   Actually, You're wrong as well. The KKK is allowed to

   (Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year).

   the U.S. 

Yes. That seems to be the problem. Even Germany now has laws for its
military where soldiers are *required* to disobey orders if they
believe the orders are morally incorrect.

Naziism is prohibited in Canada, Germany (others?). How pray tell is
Canda any less free than the US?

     Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a 
satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
months to years. 

     My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT 
satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In 
particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in 
altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude 
of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 
March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the 
limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.) 

    This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 
degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is 
unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But 
it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
situation. 

    (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

Encrypting just the radio link doesn't make sense to me.  That means the telco

I was a cryptologic tech in the US Navy (CTRSN, nothing big).  All 'spooks'
in the Navy are required to know the "gist" of "USSID 18", the Navy-way of
naming a particular Presidential "Executive Order".  It outlines what spooks
can and can't do with respect to the privacy of US nationals.

The following information is (of course) UNCLASSIFIED.

The whole issue hangs about what you mean by "wiretap".  If the signal can
be detected by "non-intrusive" means (like radio listening), then it may be
recorded and it may be "analyzed".  "Analyzed" means that it may be either
deciphered and/or radio-location may be used to locate the transmitter.

The catch is this:  Any and all record of the signal and its derivatives
may only be kept for a maximum of 90 days, after which they are destroyed
unless permission is obtained from the US Attorney General to keep them.

Subject: Will FEDs troll for mutilated law enforcement blocks?
Originator: koontzd@phobos
Organization: Loral Rolm Computer Systems
Lines: 121

From Denning:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U.
Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
analysis).

Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip
and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:
    
	1) Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the family key

	2) Receive Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the
	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -
	    checksums, sequence control, etc.).

This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is
a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits
as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block
can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed
Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,
The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits
of N in E[N; F].

The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the
mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the
entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme
such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block
can be recovered are lessened.

What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the
serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission
becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol
transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?

One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block
containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.

The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to 
detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law
enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state
for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.

It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within
the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,
requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting
and decrypting E(M; K);

The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including
on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could
be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?

Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without
redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial
number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should
not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for
procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,
stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice
from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with
a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and 
distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen
clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not 
sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.
This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or
spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted
stream.

Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned
scheme.

******************************************************************************

If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use
them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid
law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching
the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet
deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement
block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,
such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require
escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.

The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of
clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated
by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream
and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key
generator synchronized between endpoints.

The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited
based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission
interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's
supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to
the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants
an encryption chip with a real time clock?

*****************************************************************************

The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated.

Are you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a 1/2" hex?  13mm
is just slightly larger...  and a 1/2 wrench won't fit on a GM 13mm
nut (my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric

Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program, available

I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming
down to earth to live as one of us "subject to sin and death" (as one of
the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was
that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the
basic definition of humanity, then Jesus "fully human" (Nicea) would not
be "subject to sin", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,
because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish
between "human" and "fallen human" makes Jesus less like one of us at the
time we need him most.

First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they 
were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical
record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as
extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)
claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing
(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,
in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son "uncreate" -- surely even 
Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's
opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed
that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require
two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because
Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,
if you accept "Nestorianism" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,
a la Chalcedon.

Second, I am not sure that "Nestorianism" is not a better alternative than
the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation
that Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think
rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate
nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine
nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature
prevailed.

Comments on the above warmly appreciated.

Jason Albert

[There may be differences in what we mean by "subject to sin".  The
original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call
Jesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that
Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by
not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do
not have to sin in order to be human.

I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I
agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think
that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in
fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was
not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of
the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he
got the better of them.

However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to
Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least
"rash and dogmatic" (as the editor of "The Christological Controversy"
refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As
regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an
impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I
think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from
Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says "To attribute also
to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics
of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,
either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the
Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and
Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the
idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine
Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some
degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his
fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off
on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us
who perpetrate the falsehood."

It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between
humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based
on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have "to some
degree" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it
must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'
participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of
identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an
incarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white
terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this
area.

You say "I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's
human nature was in heaven."  I don't think that's required by
orthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.

Obviously some reporter for the Ottawa Sun got taken by an April

Bruins.  

Like for example...who is going to reimburse the Flyers for the
$15 million they paid to the Nordiques...like the Senators are
going to get Lindros and $15 million.  The Flyers sent the
equivalent of 6 or 7 players (when you include the draft choices)
to Quebec, and they are going to get only four back.

Some reporter was had real badly and someone must be having a

Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are
1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than
nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many
fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many
fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were
adopted ("why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.").  
3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally
not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil
plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.

Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants
of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the 
heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in
order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is
normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is
desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because 
moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine 
low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity
causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest
pressure condensing environment is always the best.  

A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where
the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the
condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the 
condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too 
hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into
steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a
particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all
costs.  

The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant
in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower 
they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in
the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 
degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is
used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower
system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water
is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,
operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order 
to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher
hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the
condenser area.

At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the
air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge
water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water
from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and
humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water
temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical
"95-95" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.
It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful
in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the
plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets
too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive
pressure.

True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and
feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard 
stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.
The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood
the costs of impure water.  By "impure", I mean water with a few
dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved
oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will 
find outside the laboratory.

The object of a cooling tower is to distribute dissolved salts in 
cooling water over large areas of farmland and to therefore decrease
farm subsidies for non-producers by rendering their land infertile.

A side effect of this deficit-reduction program is that they provide
a low-T reservoir for a variety of industrial processes.

Now you know.

Two approaches that I've used: Tofranil, 50 mg qhs, Naproxen 250mg bid.
The Naproxen doesn't seem to be as bad as things like Tylenol in promoting
the analgesic abuse Headache.  DHE IV infusions for about 3 days (in

| 
| This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes
| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.
| Basically it's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a
| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren't Jews, so we
| aren't part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in
| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to
| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this
| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but
| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles
| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,
| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.

1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom
4:15 notes that "where no law is, there is no transgression."  Not only
did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it
was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).

2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise
which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the
people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised
"what ever He says to do we will do."  That is why the new covenant is
based on "better promises" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law
God promised to "put my laws in their minds and write them on their
hearts" (Heb. 8:10).

3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The
Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt
had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been
even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly
Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at
any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was
*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).

4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*
the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the
covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises
belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born
into Israel is not enough "For they are not all Israel, which are of
Israel" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says "if ye be Christ's, then are ye
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."  All Christians are
Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the
criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the
promise God made to all his people the Israelites.

| 
| While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,
| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,
| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected
| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it's the
| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.
| 
| These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments
| into "moral" and "ceremonial".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to
| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are
| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to
| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except
| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take
| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on
| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to
| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians
| are free to choose the specific time we worship.

People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath
commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the
ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even
if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan
sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,
sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders
agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in
soc.religion.christian.bible-study).
| 
| A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin
| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer
| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior
| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still
| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally
| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not
| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While
| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it's not safe for us to go
| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We're too good at
| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral
| guidance, from things like Jesus' teachings, Paul's advice, etc.
| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same
| function as, and have largely the same content as, the "moral law" in
| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed
| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that
| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.
| 
I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God
says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,
why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the
Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important
enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that
the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but
freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in
court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me
grace, do I walk out of the court saying "I can now go on speeding, for I
am now under grace?"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed
limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 "Di we then make void the law through
faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law."  "Wherefore the law is
holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Rom. 7:12).

| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of
| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's
| resurrection.  There's some debate about what Acts shows about early
| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish
| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but
| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.
| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also
| implies gatherings on that day.
| 
| There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to
| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day
| Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a
| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and
| that I Cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service.

Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows
that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did
not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to
Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate "lay by him in store"
with "go to a worship service."
| 
| It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's time.  See
| Rom 14:5.  Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about
| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific
| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that
| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his
| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the
| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue
| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col
| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly
| mentions Sabbath.)

Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath
day of the moral law.
| 
| There are some differences among Christians about use of the word
| "Sabbath".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish
| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the
| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply
| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering
| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It
| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated
| for Jews, and the Lord's Day -- which is the free Christian worship.
| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There
| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians
| support "blue laws", both in secular law and church law, setting aside
| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical
| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish
| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the
| Lord's Day.
| 
Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments
which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a
God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could
not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a
broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law
breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to
follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to
make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to
kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight
when placed next to the word of God.

Darius

[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I
think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is
probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing
what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally
accept that those who "esteem all days alike" are similarly doing
their best to honor the Lord.

However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous
proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I
indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.

The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually
about something else.  They both look like they are talking about
nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says "and they
gathered every Sunday for worship".  We get various pieces of
information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  

Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple
worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the
temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of
Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us
what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'
confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no
reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the
Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to
me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to
see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,
Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit
enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says
that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's
collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially
to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,
but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be
when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do
it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.
So I think the most obvious reading of this is that "on the first day
of every week" simply means every time they gather for worship.  

I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements
is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian
worship was.

Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life,
Islam places the rights of society and every member in it above

As a Muslim living in a non-Muslim land I am bound by the laws of the land
I live in, but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my 
life. If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent
that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must 
leave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law
but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.

In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam
are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect
the genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state 
laws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws
on religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving)
etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military
protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.

After the Fatwa didn't Rushdie re-affirm his faith in Islam, didn't
he go thru' a very public "conversion" to Islam? If so he is binding
himself to Islamic Laws. He has to publicly renounce in his belief in Islam
so the burden is on him.

I know of two people who have horrer stories about the DOS 6.0. 
That's 100% of the people I know with DOS 6.0. Both have
had to reformat their disks and start over.  One had drive D compress and work
fine, only to compress C: to have the thing choke, spit out an unintelligable

the drive, I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known

The other may have been a marginal drive, however, his upgrade failed,
he had to format a floppy disk at 6.0, format the drive, and then reinstall.

I make now claims since I was not driving at the time, however, be careful
and make sure you back important things up.

     Hello, 

   Let me introduce a problem:

   When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using 
AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? / 
   When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal 
to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.
   I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/
   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted 
by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...
The output value was only about 10% of the previous one! 
   Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter 
actually measure? And what does it show?  

   Related question (less important to me):
   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
analog ones? 

   Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at
avm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here. I would appreciate either

Or alternatively, 75% of the questions cover 10% of the topics in this group -

So the other 25% cover 90% of the topics, making them rarely asked and thus in

Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card

Several problems:

1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB
   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED
   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K
   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB
   VRAM.

2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:

   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an
      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often
      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
      be.

   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the
      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you
      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).

3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development
   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger
   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the
   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed
   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The
   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.

   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter
   "R". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it
   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.

   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive
   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with
   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles
   the VGA mode.
   
   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use
   another monitor in place of my usual one.

I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be
remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits
part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
(BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might
call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design
is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay
League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore
can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible
theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

You might also check out _Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur_
(I think), by Hayward and <someone>.  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers.

Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel
seems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel
of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.

Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.

Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)
frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture
to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous
frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.

>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)

Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+
card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24
bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.

Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.

My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has
precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial
heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip.

It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case, so
the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go.

All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable.
There are other "board" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't
know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment.

The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit.

PC-Connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day
delivery.  The Y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the
power supply.  PCP&C make the best power supplies available IMHO.

Yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the
distance to absolute zero. And in any case you're going to have to
borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this
darling anyway. Btw, you're probably going to want those big capacitors
you found to fire the solenoid -- High current drain on frozen batteries
can be an ugly thing.

You could use DOS 6 to do this partly.  You can set up different config.sys
and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their
menu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini
and system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows,
it can copy back generic .ini files if you want.

This is the only way I can think of.  There may be some programs somewhere
that allow you to do this better, though using DOS 6 allows each person to
have a custom config.sys and autoexec.bat.

Reply-To: bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu

One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the
relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty
acids (FAs).

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got
out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several
studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing
inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are
discussed in "Inflammatory Bowel Disease," MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]

But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be
picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In
the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the
studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the
_other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed
layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are
consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoid
products to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad."
Isn't this ratio the issue?

What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA
supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs
appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the
low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed "Pro-Life" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

And the two simplest refutations are these:

(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.
I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that
the recorded "impact" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other
contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain
being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection
is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years
after the supposed event.

(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no
one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).
Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one
gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make
up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does
record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really
guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.

Well, I am not Andy, but if you had familiarized yourself with some of

would be aware of the fact that none of them claims that proteins were
assembled randomly from amino acids. It is current thinking that RNA-

were assembled by some kind of primitive translation machinery.

Not bad. We had a similar situation. Slowpitch softball, bases loaded,
weakest hitter at the plate. He hits a line drive over the third
baseman's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in
foul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field.
But the umpire called fair ball! I was coaching third, yelling at evrybody 
to move up a base. The ump's position: "it was still fair when it
passed third base". 
Why the other team didn't immediately protest I'll never know; we
certainly weren't going to argue about it, since every body did manage
to advance one base safely.

There was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner
from second base) leg, fielded by the SS, steps on second to force the
runner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire
called a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.

Remember to use binary mode!


What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......
---------------------------------------------------------
Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of
its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.

			    HyperHelp 3.0
			    -------------
HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context
sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one
line function call, application developers can access the
full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on
their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,
project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.
This allows a documentation department to maintain a single
set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and
Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. 
And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!

New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character
based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History
window.

			     Xprinter 2.0
			     ------------
Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated
printer support to their existing/new X based applications
very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the
display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code
for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for
our demo and see Xprinter in action.

If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support
to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier
this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that
resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
for UNIX SVR4.2.


Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about
HyperHelp and Xprinter. 

If you have any questions or comments, send them to us at:
info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.

				Happy demoing,



					The staff at Bristol Technology

    The above claim that you do not hate anybody may not be quite
    true.  The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the
    intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in
    this group.  Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel, 
    and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a
    great steaming heap of hatred!
    
    You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for
    objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from 
    their original context so that they can be used to further an 
    agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel.

    You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image 
    of several Israeli leaders.  I can't say if you actually HATE
    these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do
    suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.
    
    So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an
    ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is 
    false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident
    that you hate the Jewish people.

    And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew.  There can
    be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish
    background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there
    is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade
    away completely, as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage
    for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that 
    you hate the Jewish people.

    And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your
    own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me 
    that you hate yourself.

Reading this definition, I wonder: when should you recognize something

might have their own ideas of what constitutes a "mistake" and which
discoveries of such previous mistakes they accept.

Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with 5MB/s and Hard drives START

 20MB $299 {$15/MB}

 80MB $449 {$5.63/MB}
120MB $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/MB

510MB $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/MB}

So scsi-1/SCSI-2 for the Mac goes down in price/MB as hard drive size goes
up {and I assume the same for the PC world.}

Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface.  In the Mac {since SCSI is THE
inteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used
for the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross
drive interfacing as fast as the OS, program, CPU, SCSI, and drive can handle 
it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}.
In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well.
Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards 
{this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'}, CD-ROM, etc.
IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any
and I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface
{Make of that what you will}
SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE.
This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water.
Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago
{When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played
and SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end
computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI
off into the statosphere price wise}
SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the
standard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it
choose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined
interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces
{at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}

Article-I.D.: news.C5x27u.D4F
Organization: University of Delaware
Lines: 42
Nntp-Posting-Host: brahms.udel.edu


I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

							Wintach
             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system:
486/33 VLB:
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, 
I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.

Well, I didn't bother writing to Boxer, Feinstein or Eshoo, the terrible

Aparently, Bentsen forwarded my letter to the BATF and they responded to 
me directly.  It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However,
I intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.

That has not been demonstrated.  Had he come to trial, there was a very real
possibility that Koresh would have gotten an acquittal on grounds of self-
defense.  All survivors of the debacle have sworn that the BATF shot first.

They "rang the doorbell" using a concussion grenade!  And if the bloody
warrants were "legal" then why were they _sealed_ after the fight started?
And if Koresh had declared himself a "private state" and was just daring the
gov't to go in, then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who
served a warrant _for_his_arrest_ (as opposed to the BATF search warrant,
which did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling
him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car?
That doesn't sound like a dictator to me, it sounds like someone who knows
he has a court battle.  Things might have gone very differently if the BATF
_had_ "rung the doorbell".

This is stupid.  That is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving
witnesses, and the BATF _has_ no tanks, nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_
the FBI using any until yesterday.  When they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed.

>The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by

"Underarmed"?  You flabberghast me, they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bullet-proof vests!  They were using concussion
grenades and full-auto weapons, what was missing low-yield tac-nukes?  This
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used, both initially and yesterday.  You should be ashamed.

They _had_ a sure-fire method: keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looney-tune religious
stunt.

Phil, I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you
will back anything, no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone
else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like.  It's people
with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust, a process
that is in place _now_ in this country, even if the tattered, pitiful remains
of the Constitution is slowing its progress.  This isn't a Libertarian issue,
others may argue that line, but from a strictly Constitutional view of a
democratic gov't, what the FBI and BATF did was wrong, wrong, wrong, even if
their _reasons_ for trying to arrest Koresh were 100% right.  _Anything_ that
leads to the deaths of 17 children, if nothing else touches your stoney

Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows

It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation

Unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so a

anything else, just define them on different com ports.  Define your internal
modem to be say, com1, and your external modem to be com3.  You really

The FBI, CIA, BATF, etc. ARE federal agencies, you are correct.  But to
think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and
that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These
agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have
ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then
tell the Prez, who says, "I knew all along".  While this may not seem right,
or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command
leading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after
all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and
maybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if
they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses
are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority
religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of
cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.
Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do
not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is
digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are
associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about
would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt
BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was
unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S
government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I
do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said
are true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President
Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives
should be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from
reaching its full potential.

This may be a stupid question, but how does the government know which keys
to ask for?

Will owners be required to REGISTER their phones, faxes, modems, etc.,
and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number?
Will there be penalities if the public does not do this?  Will identification
(the National Health Care ID, perhaps) be required when purchasing a
Clipper-equipted phone?

Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of
a conversation?  Identification which could be used to automatically
log who calls whom?  (The _phone_ company keeps records, but this 
information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave
relay station).

This raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications
encryption key.  Will it be something that is derived from information
exchanged at the start of the conversation -- and hence derivable by
an eavesdropper?

Of course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine as
Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church
has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say
that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free
will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also
affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and
Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with
the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). 
For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,
who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final
perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those
without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their
obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need
it, as they had freely chosen hell.
							  ^^^^^^^^^^^
People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own
effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined
them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish
because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were
deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and
sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.

>yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that
>punishment at the last judgement. 

Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some
blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),
for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And
those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one
or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal
punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it
(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were
forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I
need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is
quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from
the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,
Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.

We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but
does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the
U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an
isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in
the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily
involved, it would not be a "just war."  "Blessed" after all, "are the
peacemakers" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our
actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is
unrelated to anything to justify it for us.

                 TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
                        TO THE SPEAKER OF THE
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
               THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE
  
  
                           April 13, 1993
  
  
  Dear Mr. Speaker:      (Dear Mr. President:)
  
  As part of my continuing effort to keep the Congress fully 
  informed, I am providing this report, consistent with section 4 
  of the War Powers Resolution, to advise you of actions that I 
  have ordered in support of the United Nations efforts in 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina.
  
  Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of 
  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively 
  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security 
  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all 
  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There 
  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages 
  in Bosnia have been bombed.
  
  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, 
  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all 
  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize 
  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-
  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  
  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air 
  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General 
  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY 
  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating 
  allies.
  
  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my 
  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to 
  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct 
  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by 
  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces 
  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and 
  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  
  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. 
  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for 
  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.
  
  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air 
  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early 
  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally 
  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the 
  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching 
  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, 
  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these 
  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such 
  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by 
  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved 
  
                                more

  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will 
  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations 
  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was 
  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully 
  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.
  
  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such 
  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces 
  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional 
  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-
  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and 
  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward 
  toward attainment of our goals in this region.
  
       	    	      	   	Sincerely,
  
  
  
  
       	    	      	   	WILLIAM J. CLINTON

We had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.
There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can
with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).

Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases
where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time
of speeding.

I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that
had stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number
of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...

In conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!

For Immediate Release                             April 23, 1993



                     Background Information:

                    Advancing U.S. Relations 
        with Russia and the other New Independent States 

                         April 23, 1993


At the Vancouver summit, President Clinton and President Yeltsin 
agreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an 
economic and strategic partnership between the U.S. and Russia.  
Since then, President Clinton has directed that a number of steps 
be taken to move this process forward.  The Administration is 
announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its 
deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based 
on its government's commitment to reform.


Executive Review of Cold War Laws

President Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the 
desirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations 
to reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted 
to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet 
Union has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other 
independent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain 
that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the 
end of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations 
with Russia and the other new independent states.

The President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and 
regulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. 
security and other national interests, such provisions can be 
revised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe 
Talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The 
President has indicated that he will welcome congressional 
efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.

This review will weigh all considerations that pertain to 
revision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may 
help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such 
provisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are 
eager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik 
legislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President 
Clinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases 
involving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By 
addressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds 
of trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between
the U.S. and the other new independent states.


Review of COCOM

It is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies 
the future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United 
States has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export 
controls to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer 
viewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in 
combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.

Steps to Improve the Security Relationship

The President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of 
efforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security 
and improve our security relationship with the Russians and the 
other states.


Accelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons

In Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the 
process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for 
elimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has 
directed the Department of Defense to complete this process well 
in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START 
I.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the 
other relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be 
exploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate 
this process.


Multilateral Test Ban

The two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a 
multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, 
and that the two governments would consult with each other 
accordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning 
consultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the 
specific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States 
expects to start this consultative process within the next two 
months.    


Detargeting

The two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear 
targeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move 
into a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need 
to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the 
past to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The 
Administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures 
that could enhance strategic stability, including recent 
proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   

Other Measures to Create a New Security Relationship

In response to the incident involving a collision between US and 
Russian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to 
discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian 
Defense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in 
late May.

Secretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with 
Defense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training 
program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint 
exercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN 
Security Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening 
such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping 
contributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, 
and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US 
and Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial 
Meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for 
enhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move 
consideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from 
the discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also 
working with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements 
in the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of 
these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our 
participation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.


Multilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform

Finally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of 
initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and 
political reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The 
Administration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to 
assemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries 
Bentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the 
Administration is continuing consultation with Congress over the 
further efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of 
reform in Russia and the other states.

                           *    *    *

The Administration believes these steps can increase American 
security while improving the relationship between the U.S. and 
Russia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent 
states.

Old pioneer song from the 1850's or so goes as follows:
  
  "In a cavern, in a canyon,
   Excavating for a mine,
   Dwelt a miner, forty-niner,
   And his daughter, CLEMENTINE"
  
Chorus:
  "Oh my darling, Oh my darling,
   Oh my darling Clementine.
   You are lost and gone forever,
   Oh my darling Clementine."
  
 I've also had it explained (but not confirmed from a reliable data
source) that CLEMENTINE is an acronym.  Something like Combined
Lunar Elemental Mapper Experiment on Extended Non Terrestrial
Intercept Near Earth.  Personally, I think that acronym was made up
to fit the name (if it really is an acronym).

        Thank you very much. These computers behave exactly like what 
you're describing. Now, my question. I am running on the lowest of all 
budgets, public education. How can I analyze this? All I need is some 
sort of packet counter. Do any exist, and where are they?
        Thanks again,

No, look again. While you never *said* it, the implication is pretty clear.
I'm sorry, but I can only respond to your words, not your true meaning. Usenet

Look, I'm not supporting *any* dogmatic position. I'd be a fool to say that
in the large group of people that are atheists, no people exist who wish to
proselytize in the same fashion as religion. How many hard atheists do you 
see posting here, anyway? Maybe I'mm just not looking hard enough...

I never meant to do so, although I understand where you might get that idea.
I was merely using the 'bible' example as an allegory to illustrate my
point.

Guilty as charged. What I *meant* to say was, the theists who *are* arrogant
are this way because they say ...  Other than that, I thought my meaning
was clear enough. Any position that claims itself as superior to another with
no supporting evidence is arrogant. Thanks for your apology, btw.

Organization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine

Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a "boxer" type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of
small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application.

For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is
exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack.

I have a few questions about the TAX on  a used car purchase.
I live in New York State, and I am going to buy a used car.
I know that I will have to pay tax when I go to register the car.
But I would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or
on the purchase price.  Also, what tax rate is used ?  The owner lives in
Albany (8% tax), and I will be living in Saratoga with 7% tax.  
Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50)
One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ?

Did I leave anything out ? What else might I have to know to purchase and
register a used car ?  (I've never done this before.)

Thank you,

You probably need an X server running on top of MS DOS.  I use Desqview/X

Coming from an idiot/crook Armenian, I'd take that as a compliment.
Your criminal grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, resorted
to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured 
petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of 
their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their 
mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. 
And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other 
nation had ever known in history.

Not really.  If whatever a particular society mandates as ok is ok, there are

So what should be the basis? Unfortunately I have to admit to being tied at

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to
use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS
limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other
standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better
performance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.

>Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's?

Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that
are written for DOS, so you need software drivers. That's not a big
deal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to
fight with any low memory problems either.

I'd be fascinated to see such evidence, please send me your article!
On the negative side however, I suspect that any such simplistic link
    abstinence-education => decreased pregnancy,
    contraceptive-education => increased pregnancy
is false.  The US, which I'd guess has one of the largest proportion of 
"non-liberal" sex education in the western world also has one of the highest
teenage pregnancy rates.  (Please correct me if my guess is wrong.)

Come on fellows! The format is quite plainly explained in the manuals.
It's in the "Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures,
and Macros" (MSC-Dev.kit for 3.1, should be also in the Borland's
manuals) pages 232-241 (depending what you need).

First there is the BITMAPFILEHEADER-struct then the BITMAPINFO which
contains the BITMAPINFOHEADER and the RGBQUAD and then the bitmap
data. AND there is also a example among the example files (MS_SDK).
Hope this helps....

Things could be worse. A lot worse! In the mid-eighties the
teen/adult sci-fi comic 2000AD (Fleetway) produced a short story
featuring the award winning character "Judge Dredd". The story
focussed on an advertising agency of the future who use high powered
multi-coloured lasers/search lights pointed at the moon to paint
images on the moon. Needless to say, this use hacked off a load of lovers,
romantics and werewolfs/crazies. The ad guys got chopped, the service
discontinued. A cautionary tale indeed!

Oh yeah, all the time.  On a nice spring/summer day, I roll down the window
and drive around looking for bikes.  When a bike motors by in the opposite
direction, I stick my arm out and hi5'em.  My arm feels like a million 
bucks when I'm doing this a 60km/h.  I do the same thing with cyclists.
The only problem with hi5ing a cyclist is their always in the right hand lane.
I hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back.  Oh well, I

InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS
6.  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people
should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  The point out
that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a
number of folks problems.

MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported
that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).

Cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned
on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $67.50, 
for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold.  I want to see
the MS spin doctors explain this.

and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 EISA system with no
luck. I end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read
part of the test. I am pretty certain that the port setting, irq & dma are
set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind,
retension, write and erase, I also booted the system clean and still the
same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. It has been
suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down.
My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting
option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do this. Am I going to
have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work

Kerry-- I'm guessing a little at this, because it's been a few years 
since I saw the info, but you will probably want to look at Air Defense 
Artillery as a specialty, or possibly Signals.  The kind of thing you're 
looking for is SDI-type assignments, but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff.
Things like hard-kill ATBM missiles, some of the COBRA rigs -- that kind 
of thing.  

Hope that gives you some ideas on where to look, though.

Hi.

I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better.
When I set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define-keys,
I can only access certain of the keys on my X-Terminal's
keyboard. I can't get e.g. F10, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn; they all
seem to have either the same or no keycode. I have a feeling
this can't be fixed in emacs itself, but that I need to do some
xmodmap stuff. Can someone help me?

By the way, I've checked the X-FAQ and posted a similar message
to gnu.emacs.help to no response.

Currently I have the following in my .emacs file (inside a 'cond'):

 ((string-match "^xterm" (getenv "TERM"))
;; done by aj 8/92. I don't know what most of this does...
   (defvar xterm-map (make-sparse-keymap) "Keymap for xterm special keys")
   (define-key esc-map "[" 'xterm-prefix)

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we
take the appellation `Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a full
grasp of contemporary `scripture'

Mat21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures...

Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing
Mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.

Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful
position to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:

Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,
Mat26:54 that thus it must be?

Mat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the
Mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples
Mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.

If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not
been accessible then it probably would be a different
matter.

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of
the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,
the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.

Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It
is not "produced": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for
example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an
earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, "hi'ipoi", the Hawaiian
word for "cherish" means "sharing food".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called "theft" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call "savages".

On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would
behoove you to study *all* of the facts.

Lines: 42
Nntp-Posting-Host: euclid.ucsd.edu


 WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi 
SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to "the extermination of the
Jewish race"--went on display Friday at the National Archives.
	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are
among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the
Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.
	"The notes give them their authenticity," said Robert Wolfe,
a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  "He was
supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his
own rules."
	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped
would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after
World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.
	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than
100 German secret police generals.  "I also want to talk to you,
quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be
mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.
I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish
race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been
written and is never to be written."  [Emphasis mine--rje]
	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as
"extermination" is *Ausrottung*.
	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be "extirpation"
or "tearing up by the roots."
	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,
"Judenevakuierung" or "evacuation of the Jews."  But archives
officials said "extermination" is the word he actually
spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.
	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's "final solution of the
Jewish question," committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.
	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is
a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum here on April 26.
	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of
Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and
an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.

You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who
can declare "total" victory and then sit back and enjoy the
applause.  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few
rigged "quotations" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir
Yassin "massacre."

You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.
At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big
difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding
"quotations" that support your preset opinions.

If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that
many of the sources of your "quotations" have an axe to grind, and
therefore you must be very careful about whom you "quote."  For
example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,
and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of
his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience
shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his
anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be
considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of
course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy
"quotation" that you can use to attack Israel.

Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a "scholar"
when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.
It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an
attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at
the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,
you will see his "indictment" to be pure hot air.  And this is the
BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning
evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as
"scholarly," he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see
that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.

The Deir Yassin "massacre" never took place as the propagandists
tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila "massacres." Do you get
the feeling people like to blame the Jews for "massacres," even if
they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews
like to do it, for reasons of their own.

Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin "massacre" stuff
with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version
unless you find something serious to contradict it.

Well said, Michael!

The Catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the Spiritual 
Works of Mercy:

admonish the sinner
instruct the ignorant
counsel the doubtful
comfort the sorrowful
bear wrongs patiently
forgive all injury
pray for the living and the dead (yes, I know there is some controversy 
                           on this and I don't want to argue about it.)

These are all things that have a direct application to usenet.  People 
ask questions and express doubts.  Some are in need of comfort or 
prayers.  Imagine what would happen to flame wars if we bore wrongs 
patiently and forgave injuries.   I would add that it is probably more 
appropriate to do any admonishing by private email than publicly.

The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which
includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some
indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor
with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion
port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. 

They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC
TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen. 

Hope this helps.

	We only need to ask the question: what did the founding fathers 
consider cruel and unusual punishment?

	Hanging? Hanging there slowing being strangled would be very 
painful, both physically and psychologicall, I imagine.

	Firing squad ? [ note: not a clean way to die back in those 
days ], etc. 

	All would be considered cruel under your definition.
	All were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers.

You are forced everyday to associate with people that you do not
wish to, and there isn't even a law that makes you do it.  But 
you do, becuase you want to go shopping, or go to work, or go to
a public park, or go to a baseball game, etc.

The process of ending discrimination is based upon the rational

     Depends on what you mean by classy. From what I've heard about
him, he was about as classy as Harold Ballard.  Only difference was
that back then almost all the owners were like that, so he seemed okay
by comparison.  Read the book "Net Worth" for one view of what Smythe

     Even more specifically, I think what Roger was saying (and I said

league great, so why should divisions, conferences etc. be named after
them instead of Morenz, Vezina, Howe, Orr etc., the people who DID
make it great.  Instead, the NHL has chosen to immortalize the men who
got rich off of the men who made the game great.

This was on "That's Incredible" several years ago.  The volume of liquid
the rat had to breath was considerably smaller than what a human would have
to breath, so maybe it is possible for a rat but not a human.

Subject: Re: Sabbath Admissions 5of5
Organization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA
Lines: 34

All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point
pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or
Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really
sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by
the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of
the Chruch to do so.

Andy Byler

[You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church
establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is
that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the
ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based
on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'
teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship
occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these
points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more
time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are
right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.

Accepting the principle of "sola scriptura" does not commit us to
obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite
clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is
on where the Bible would have us place the line.

By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters
that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to
determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that
the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship
falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or
(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to
decide.

Subject: IDE/ESDI coexistence
Summary: How to make IDE and ESDI controllers live together???
Keywords: HD, controller, IDE, ESDI, disks
Organization: Universite de Montreal
Lines: 57

Hello all,

You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)
This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.

Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with
serials/paral/floppies and 
	- IDE controller "clone" Gw2760-EX
		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 
	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).

Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):
	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages
		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)
	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.
		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,
		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)

Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks 
simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected.

Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al.
Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount
the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.

I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,
or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, 
depending on setup/jumpers.

Useful suggestions might be:
- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
- Do I need some driver to make it work?
- --- " --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?
- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE
is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not 
rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.
- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change
a chip or put a jumper!

Also useful:
- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.
- ftp archives with relevant info.
- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)
- any hints into inner workings of the system ... 
- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )

Direct or posted replies are ok.
	Many thanks,
			Cat.

Read the documentation for the SimpleMenu (4.2.3 Positioning the SimpleMenu).
The reference is to the R5 documentation.

I had not done this before but in less than 10 mins I knocked up the following
Wcl application that does what you want using a Command widget. Even if you are
not familiar with Wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
performing studies that are "blind" in various ways.  Some of these
are:

  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the
     control group or the test group.

  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to 
differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis
is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on
which it is based so that others can verify it.  

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because
those who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.  It is not
considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,
the control and test groups are treated alike.

I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on
another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created
using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The
image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because
the server on the other machine is using a different colormap.

I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay,
performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work
because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap.

Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or
is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap
but couldn't get that to work either.

Any help would be appreciated.

That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book

apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.

I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one
voice, and he does not contradict himself.  

The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired
by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more
guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided
that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books
such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example,
the Lutheran hymn "Now Thank We All Our God" quotes a passage
from this book.

The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's
history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where
this sort of discussion ultimately ends.

Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at
least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.

I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But
Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.
That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded "seasoning".

In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind

Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know
what it means.  :)

But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball
is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.

I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from
your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I
think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly
more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It
may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.
Seems like pretty good common sense to me.

Either the government has force available to it, or it doesn't.  The
Libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone
else uses force first -- even when that first force is not directed
against the government, but one of its citizens.  That all being true, 
what safeguards do we have against the government CLAIMING that some
initiation of force on its part is really a response?  (Like the burning
of the Maine, the Tonkin Gulf incident, or the assault on Waco?)

I ask this not to argue, but to understand.

Subject: PC fastest line/circle drawing routines: HELP!
Organization: Brandeis University
Lines: 41

hi all,

IN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing
	  on SVGA graphics.

COMPLETE:
	I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular
graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)

Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.

Platform: 386/486 class machine.
	  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics
		(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering
		 purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for
		 speed reason.)
         (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA
          cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)

What I'm looking for?
1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes
   on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.
   Presumably in assembly languagine.
	Yes, VERY FAST please.
2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.
   Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of
   text, else later.
   (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule)
2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the 
   project.

Final remarks;-
non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.

	Any help is appreciated.
	thanks

mserv@mozart.cc.iup.edu (Mail Server) writes:
| One thing I don't understand is why being sacred should make the
| temple rituals secret.

The "so sacred it's secret" explanation is a bit misleading.  While
there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no
injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But
since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather
keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.

But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants
explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the
ceremony itself.

| Granted, the Gnostic "Christians"
| had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely
| from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.

There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.
One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was
written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret
information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that
those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve
(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).

Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and
bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He
claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the
apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which
we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,
op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*
gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.

Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize
secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching
certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a
dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is "You seem
to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you
both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not
permitted to me now to disclose these things to you" (_Clementine
Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_
it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but
can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.

Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I
don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I
believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of
early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.

| Neither New Testament
| Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.

But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect
to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of
Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on
temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in
temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that
worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*
practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such
descriptions proves they did not exist?

Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from
which I have taken a few:

1. "It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven, but to them it is not given" (Matt. 13:11).

2. "All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given"
(Matt. 19:11).

3. "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now" (John 16:12).

4. "The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,
but I shall shew you plainly of the Father" (John 16:25).

5. "... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"
(1 Cor. 3:1-2).

6. "Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...
come unto you and speak face to face" (2 Jn. 1:12).

(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)

Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe
they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught
were actually taught openly.

| I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire
| practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual)
| from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative
| information on whether or not this claim is true?

Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple
endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.
There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not
change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had
ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his
time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific
connection has yet been established.

My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite
transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe
that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As
our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the
recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who
charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have
adequate knowledge of the rites in question.

Wrong about what?   I think they are correct in thinking that a 
well-placed bomb or six would get headlines, but I think they are 
wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a 
Buddhist.

Maybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide
against the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans 
are now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like
the Chinese occupiers.   Every action is its own reward.

> Clearly the occupation of Tibet _has_ been largely ignored.

On the other hand, people who are aware of the occupation are mostly
full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up
with it.   And what does it cost us to admire them?   Zip.

> Are Tibetans currently "people of peace"?  Do they serve themselves 
> well or badly by being so?

Yes they are, and whether this serves them well or not depends on 
whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence.
And without political independence can they preserve their cultural
and religious traditions?

> Would an increased level of violence make them "terrorists"?

The Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists, just as
the Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements
as terrorists.

> Assuming that the group advocating this course is correct, and

Better off in what way?   As proponents of pacifism or as 
proponents of political autonomy?

And better off in what time-scale?   The Soviet Empire practised
cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities,
some of which resisted violently, and some of which did not, but
in the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least
some of the minorities survived.

Now some of the minorities are fighting one another.    Is that
because they have to, or because violent resistance to an oppressive
Empire legitimized violence?

	I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick,
Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although
they were not great players themselves.  

	I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people
have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,
then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being
uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize
what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something
abotu the history of the game.  
 
>The history of the names can be put rather succinctly.  All of the aforemen-

	No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say
that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are
assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy
individual (from what I have heard). 

	Also, isn't the point of "professional" hockey to make money
for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
deserved).

The onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that
theist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say
one thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its
opposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it's there
for anyone to see.  It's almost an epidemic in this country.

Just for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye

I think the question is: What is extra-scientific about this?  

It has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on
where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered
legitimate hypotheses.  The point, in short, is this: hypotheses and
speculation in science may come from wild flights of fancy, 
daydreams, ancient traditions, modern quackery, or anywhere else.

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low
carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,
digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
than amplitude modulated TV.

The argument by Jawad Ali is funny, He writes:
"The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider
Ahmadies to be Muslims"

Which is a wrong statement. In the light of Dr. Ijaz's statement, the
above statement should be corrected:
".......................................is that (some) non-Ahmadi Muslims
don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims"

So, the problem does not get solved:-) Who is a muslims and who is not?
Humans cannot decide. Humans may not declare others faiths. Its that 
simple. I don't understand, why the mere use of the word "ISLAM" is
becomming such a big issue. I have seen numorous postings on the net
on this subject, and all they say, "No, NO, you cannot use ISLAM as 
the name of your newsgroup". ?? 

I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
the name of other's faiths? Who gives them this authority? Quran? or
Hadith? or something else? I want to know this! 

Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers, Did _EVER_ the 
Holy Prophet of Islam (Muhammad PBUH), say to anyone who called
himself a Muslim:

No, You are not a Muslim ! ???????

NEVER! I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single 
such evidence from the history of Islam!

Hence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how
could the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do
it to anyone. Do you consider yourself above the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUH) ?? 


Sincerely,
Nabeel.

Subject: Re: Laser vs Bubblejet?
Organization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine
Lines: 90

There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers
available from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and
possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with
rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right
side (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a
gray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow
your cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information
packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a
coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new
capping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find
that the cartidges now last longer.

I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your
nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.

HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical
components that vary depending on the starting level printer and
the level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original
desket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are
likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new
deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an
original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no
soldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping
the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP
service center for further information.

The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from
the PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser
printers.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a
raster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material
difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the
accumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously
slow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are
still guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect
works, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works
efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.

The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that
permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one
megabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as
about 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for
its internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded
printing that allows incrmental download of the image with
compression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable
fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.

A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This
is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet
printer.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer
has completed its warm-up cyle.

Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image
deterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but
matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.
Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the
problem.

Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable
components.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,
mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste
could use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing
stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the
laserjet IV.

Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous
silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image
drum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice
print engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has
a neat modular paper source and stacker system.

The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower
than any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are
subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The
usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.
The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a
single part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is
almost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,
though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.
I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.

It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If
you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the
appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,
the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.

 That doesn't seem like a fair comparison.  Infrared astronomy 
 didn't really get started until something like 25 yrs. ago; it
 didn't explode until IRAS in 1983.  Gamma-ray (and I think 
 X-ray) observations didn't really get started until the '70s.
 I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in 
 general, and I know that extreme UV (short of 1000 Angstroms)
 observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost 
 no history except a few observations on Skylab in the '70s.

 Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only 
 had access to optical or radio instruments.  Now, with far more
 instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has
 resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of 
 total astronomical work.

 Hmm, some of the folks in this department planning on using

	No chance.  If that CS ignited at all, it would have been

	And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people
who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A
fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We
all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have
firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding
upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to
do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with
a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting
the many?  We say "no," while others say "yes."

	It is this "giving a little" that makes Americans wary...
We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a
Chamberlain "gave a little" to a particular fascist/short asshole,
and how such "appeasement" worked.  While it might work in some
instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict
the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a

	Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in
the USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be
willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,
cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the
arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more
people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict
cars than it does guns.  How one defines "essential" often depends
upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we
look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.

>EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were
>more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!

	This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As
Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even
when given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did
with an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first
acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show
that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.
Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown
or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.
One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.

	One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is
their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being
brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God
the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father
usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me. 
	Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not
fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both
without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both
a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find
sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible
for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat
each other.

Sounds like it is an SMD interface to me, not being at work now
to actually count pins.  there are two varients, SMD  and
SMDC (I think), only minor differences between them.  Widely used
prior to the advent of SCSI for large drives (or all drives) on minis

You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in
front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).
My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.

Good UV ("blacklight") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  I'd proceed by
getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an
electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.

Beware.  There is only one such *copyrighted* image and the company

Alberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  You are now making the exact point
that I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't not
have to believe in the "religious" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine
Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out of
Judaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily
removing yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself
Jewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue
that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of
dissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by
converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most
open nation.  We have no quotas!

So I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion
(not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism.  You come to your incorrect conclusion
because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and
when you define judaism.

I'll probably get flamed for this, but when I was a kid we would go to
my uncles cabin on Middle Bass Island on Lake Erie. We always came home
with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had
burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear
finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The
application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of
the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution
though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.

(If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me
toast.:)

Subject: commandments I (the basics)
Organization: PANIX Public Access Unix, NYC
Lines: 205

Why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*)
want to find "commandments" in the books regarded as scripture?  What's
going on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more
open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is
the *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted "at" me often
enough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said
to have) said, "If you love me, you will obey my commands."  [John 14:15]

I am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I
should do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,
but still under His direction, though we both call God "Abba."  Christians,
therefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and
discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.
Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as "slaves of
Christ") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts
(whether classified as "inspired" or not) that are held up as models, in an
effort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges
from "devotional" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-
ical scripture as "the Word of God."  And at the highest pitch, this leads
to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that
can act as "absolute" guidance for our actions.

The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am
going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians
have looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not
because *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay
is Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the
witness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments
can we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard
question.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the
discussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike
*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason
and c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]

Earlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] "I give you a new 
commandment: love one another."  This is the ONLY place in the NT where
Christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting
on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we
*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus
says, "Take this [bread]; this is my body."  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,
Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),
and hence this, too, is a "commandment."

In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider
circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the
evangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or
entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment
from our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this
is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy
in which these words operate to "bind" Christians to the original command
to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.

I am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that
it is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.
I take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,
that *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command
directed at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.
The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific
context of its statement to my own context as a "disciple" of Christ.

All reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out
of the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts
-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native
languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without
*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original
languages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,
that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control
[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current
purposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already
coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world
than the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-
vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we
can read the texts as the original audience might have done.

Among the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*
commandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that
one occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic "Great Commandment" is
that we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom
we congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, "You have learnt
how it was said: 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy.  But I
say to you: love your enemies."  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted
does NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.
(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the "love" should extend to strangers
amongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,
goes on to have Jesus say. "Even sinners love those who love them." [6:27]
All of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the
scope of the "new commandment" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In
short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command
that is "in force" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other
Christians.

Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is
the case of the "Great Commission" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve
are sent out to evangelize, "Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close
at hand."  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather
specific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in "Do not
turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town"
-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to
Jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians
than the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING
such an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference
is NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by
the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to
have felt obliged to "proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand"
even (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to
the ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as
a "commandment" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I "accept" this?  I don't
know.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of
inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)
infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in
the gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this
kind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*
have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable
length) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*
involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural
(though people will do their best to "justify" their assumptions by OTHER
references to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)

Let's move on to the "Great Commandment" -- that we should love God with
our whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic
"equivalent" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED
as a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with
the Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]

	"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees
	they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,
	"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?"

It is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'
answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a
polemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer
in a far more positive light as (so the "scribe" in this version says)
"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word
originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)
or sacrifice."  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question
"to disconcert" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains
[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one
could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this
said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on
Christians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each
case that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears
HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about
what WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on
our understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite
different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.

The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted
that ONLY in Luke do we get the "fixing" of this command by the parable of
the Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where
7:12 gives the "Golden Rule" as "the meaning of the Law and the Prophets"
(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation
before Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely
reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not
*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of
inter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this "intertextuality."

My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ "has" to apply beyond the 
community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,
applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the
presentation not saying so explicitly) a "commandment" to Christians.
Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point
out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains
of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.

The contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at
those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as 
commandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is 
pretty clear, "The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty
of adultery against her."  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew
has an escape clause [ "except in the case of fornication", 5:31 ]. This
seems to be a rather clear "commandment" (whether or not we take Matthew's
reservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,
at least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were
not explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the
things people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands
of Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists
of the synoptic tradition?

I'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this
is enough to start with.  The theme is: "finding commandments in scripture
is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,
that is, our own cultural biases."  I have, so far, identified a very few
"commandments" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in
these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these
difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce
commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no
evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn
*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or
misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that
US law refuse to allow it, or refuse "unrepentant divorcees" places in
their churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into 
consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in
even the most "liberal" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal
Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has
recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a
"private" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the "public" ceremony
he celebrated need not go through an agonizing "examination" by officials
who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands
we are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively
CREATED by a famous divorce! ]

To Rob and all others that have been debating about the wood stove.
   The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the 
building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed
with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit 
for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims 
that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped
into the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either
bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours.
I don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CS
gas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY 
uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in 
the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less 
eat.  So my question now is "why were they cooking food?"
   I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire.
But that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more
crazy than the ATF/FBI claim).

If I remember rightly PKU syndrome in infants is about 1/1200 ? They lack
two genes. And people who lack one gene are supposed to be 1/56 persons?
Those with PKU have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine. And those
who only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to
be producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame. 

The methol, formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heating?

I don't drink it. I figure sugar was made for a reason. To quickly and

The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem. A "quick
look" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having
studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one
stage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying
theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.
The clash between Jeremiah and the "false prophets" was primarily in
the theological realm. The "false prophets" understood their relatioship
to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is
possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,
which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's
descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part
of the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never
allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a
Judahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly
been Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the
theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel
through Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant
after the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the
local prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic
covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah
spoke his prophesies. The "judgement prophesies" were deeply loaded with
theological meaning.

In my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson
"New York will burn" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic
theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.

Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the
rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe,
to treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--
a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd
had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,
I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active
ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical
sputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.
The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in
human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the
reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.

This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there's
little risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result.

	The chip only supports the following operation:

		1)  Return N[0]

	Anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying
	the chip (U[1],...,U[A],F,N[0]).

	U[1],...,U[A] can not be determined except by destroying the chip.
	(Unfortunately this may not be true in reality. I suppose it's
	possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a
	sophisticated[sp?] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses.)

	The U's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies.

Notes:
	For tapping escrow agency Y is given N[0], E(K0[Y], U0[Y]), N[1],
	E(K1[Y], U1[Y]) and returns K0[Y], K1[Y].

	LEA's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from
	both chips and the encrypted partial keys. This allows the agencies
	to record that both chips were tapped.

	LEA's only get the session key, not the key to all conversations
	of a particular chip. This precludes real-time decrypting of a

Observation:
	In order for any secure by "tap-able" communication scheme to work,
	the active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret is
	revealed, communications by those that know the secret can be made
	"un-tap-able". Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm

The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector 
are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the
cable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB
port. If you take it to an Apple Repair Centre, that
means a new motherboard (though a component replace IS

Same goes for serial ports (LocalTalk as well)

Subject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)
Organization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand
Lines: 67

OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
(for better or for worse).

I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV
a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
"2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
frames.

I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used
for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
"preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
switching.

A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
even more...

Point 1:

I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole
"yeast issue" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings
of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon",
necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully
cognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  For the
situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can
have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the
world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,
and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic".
It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much
more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of
this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially
equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan
the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get
really "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they
otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional
"difficult" patient.

Point 2:

I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not
prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments
have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed
clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are
part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any
differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it
follows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a non-
therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or
theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation
of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from
a treatment point-of-view.

And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/
science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as
also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people
that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where
"standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and
wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is in
itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying
intent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health of
the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the
patient should come first when considering treatment.

What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both
the "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I
outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any
physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe
alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)
for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted
(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such
therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that
there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived
from them.

This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies
the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients
who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted
medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the
doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing
their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical
training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control
more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned
could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most
productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm
sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented
more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.

Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to
why I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real
difficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure
"scientific" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical
treatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with and
by the "scientific" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.
Just my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)

		EXACTLY!!  Read that one sentence in there..."to the degree

	So what is justifiable?  As you stated very explicitly from the new

	the peace.  Since that does not apply *at all* to this country, the
	logical conclusion (based on your own premises) is that one must be

That's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked "Why not," I'll
respond.

Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other
factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control
is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to 
incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).
Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.
Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely
to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer
fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.

Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used
their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though
they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.

The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The
space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to
temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation
effects on materials), so your "fabric" may not retain any flexibility
for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure
changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could
lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.

These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
success.

Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you

Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems
are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural
system is a subset of the objective ones.

I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although
it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that
homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean "bisexuality?"

But a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be

Yes, and I think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work.  You think

Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the

Cleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-))
and a lifetime warranty.  The whole package was assembled at AT&T Paradyne,

Cleveland to Pittsburgh.. :-)  On the down side they only ship UPS COD.

I would further add that a 486/50,S3/928,8mb,15",200mbDISK is going to cost
/WAY/ more than $900, probably $3,000.  Color makes it not apples/apples too.
Xterminals provide better price/performance than PCs.  You can make a PC
much cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make PC's perform great, and
cost more.  You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability
of a PC.  For home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.

Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.
It's small enough that I will attach it.

I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB
cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to
40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective
difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache
card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously
better.  I do not have an FPU.

The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers
offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference
between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well
under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.

If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to
see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called
"Performance Rating" numbers by themselves are of no interest. 

Cheers.

This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.

I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors. While PC users tend to
customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their 
command line.

So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them
that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has
done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception.

Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to
all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users. We here on the net are not mainstream computer users.

I have been following this thread on talk.religion,

the different non-biblical argument those who oppose the Sabbath present. 

One question comes to mind, especially since my last one was not answered
from Scripture.  Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.

There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial. 
Answer this:

Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical
basis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial?
OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to
Gentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been
annulled?  References please.

If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to
Gentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were now
grafted into the commonwealth of Israel?

Wait a minute.  I agree with you that people have to take responsibility
for their own behavior (I assume that's what you meant by the word
"account"), but also for "the behavior of their immediate community"?

First of all, how "immediate" are you talking about, and secondly, I
have a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice
which charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or
accounting for the actions of a different person...

I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip).
When xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely
or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed
by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if
xlock is NOT running.  No other processes seem to affect my
runtimes, yet this is very consistent!

Any explanations, real or imagined :)

Hi there!

What is your recommendation for a good hard-disk driver software for
non-Apple drives? I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media
drive, but maybe for some normal drives too.
I have heard and seen good things about SilverLining, but don't know
any competitors. It does not need to be fancy, filled with features...
I more like it affordable.

	I'm not sure that you can distinguish between myth and legend so
neatly, or at all.  A myth is more than a single story.  The thought 
structure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as
important a part of the myth as the story itself.  Thus, I can think of
no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person
to another within a single culture which won't rest upon that underlying
thought structure, and thus transmit some of that culture's mythical
"truths" along with it.

 I refer you to the bonobos, a species of primate as closeley related to
humans as chimpanzees (that is, very closely). They have sex all the
time, homosexual as well as heterosexual. When the group finds food, they
have sex. Before the go to sleep at night, they have sex. After they
escape from or fight off prdators, they have sex. Sex serves a very important
social function above and beyond reproduction in this species. A species
closely related to humans. There is some indication that sex performs
a social function in humans, as well, but even if not, this shows that
such a function is not *impossible*.

I think it's simply because DOS doesn't use the IRQ for anything. OS/2 does,

For a VGA card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them
back and expect it to work.  You have to create a new WIN.COM file.  Try
the command (you will have to worry about what directories each file is in
since I don't know your setup):

COPY /B WIN.CNF+VGALOGO.LGO+VGALOGO.RLE WIN.COM

(I grabbed this from _Supercharging Windows_ by Judd Robbins--great book)
This is also how you can put your own logo into the Windows startup screen.
An RLE file is just a specially compressed BMP file.

Hope this helps

Sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the IIvx's he has in
stock.  I can imaging that they are getting hard to sell, given that 
 1. a C610 is way faster, and is comparable in price.
 2. an LCIII is about the same speed, and is way cheaper.
So your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people
that IIvx's are a much better buy than a C610 just so he can get rid of all
his old stock!

No disrespect to dealers or the IIvx intended!

Perhaps so. I was only responding to the "Yankees of the 20's and 30's" 
part of the comment. If those teams were a 'sure thing' and lost, 
then it's probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another

Hello there.  The other day I was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought
about constructing an old-time crytal radio set.  I figured on
substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the
antenna coil, etc., myself.

The only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning
capacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which
used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  Well these things seem to
be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmer
capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this
application.

So, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the 
0--360 pF range?

Manythanks.

Ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. The solution is simple. Sort of
like the advice my Aunt always gave -- never scratch your ear with anything

If you have pieces of ring, con rods, valve heads or stems, just reach into
the sump through the hole in the block that was associated with the creation
of those large bits and pieces. Anything you can't remove with one hand

Summary: My air vents don't work on my 71 Skylark

I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if
it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these
Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.

The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is
stuck in the "vent" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air
flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't 
live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the 
defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,
kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.

I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think
the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down
and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-
side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is
probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.

Two questions:

	1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than
	the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?

	2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there
	a way to "fix" this?

OS/2.)

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  IBM has nothing to do with these files or
this post.  It's personal this time (and every time I post -- see the
signature).

Due to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I've
collected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision
of the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows
with the drivers available to the general public at this time.  All files
will function under the most recent OS/2 2.1 beta and those I've tried have
worked under OS/2 2.0+SP.  Not all files have been fully tested.

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  They represent a personal collection, not
anything resembling an officially supported set.

As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts:
1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can
   stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in
   shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-).
2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of
   spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor.
3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability
   to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking
   in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play
   around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable
   about what you're doing.
4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files
   you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.
   Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your
warrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don't have that many
monitors.

Installation: unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable, usually
c:\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation
diskette to change your adapter or settings.

Packing: these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility.  
You will need PKZip 2.x if you don't have the INFOZIP utilities.

Submitting:  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS
files for your favorite monitors.  I'm always interested in collecting more.

grady@netcom.com suggests using a common but restricted-distribution private
key to allow public key system encrypted postings. In theory that will work
fine as long as the privae key remains secure.

In practice it would be a good idea to check to see if that would be a
violation of some net rule, practice, custom, etc. I don't say it would be,
just that it would be a good idea to check. This is not like rot13 where
everybody can have the key trivially.

It would also be a good idea to check to see if such posts would be
forwarded by the sites needed to make the chain work.

Of course there'd be no problem with a discussion group travelling over
facilities entirely under the control of the members. Probably there would
also be no problem with a mailing list approach. It might even  be fun for
some.

"Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier"
Sponsored by the Planetary Studies Foundation

The Planetary Studies Foundation is sponsoring a one week class for
teachers called "Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier." The class will be
held at the Sheraton Suites in Elk Grove, Illinois from June 14 through
June 18. Participants who complete the program can earn two semester
hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the
class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.

The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space
Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool
to get students excited about learning and interested in science.

Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:
     > Living in Space
     > The Space Shuttle
     > The Space Station
     > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society
     > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics
     > The Solar System

There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space
station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the
Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and
the Museum of Science and Industry.

Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United
States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by
the Planetary Studies Foundation.

The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring
Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President
of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9
which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June
17.

The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials,
continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest
tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an
additional charge to receive the two hours of graduate credit. For any
additional information about the class, contact the Science Learning
Center at (708) 359-7913.

However, I feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings (see 
top).  Your statement of 'responsibility' is felt as an attack towards the 
members of this group.  You are attempting to make the members of this group
be REQUIRED to answer.  The only people who should make a statement are people
who have experienced the problem and found a workable solution.

Many people are interested, but have no input.  I will restate that your last
sentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group.  If people have
input, they will give it.  If they do not, YOU should not make them feel 
compelled (sp?) to respond.  

If you wish to continue this conversation, PLEASE send e-mail.  DO NOT repost or
attempt to bait me, I will not make another post (and may I make the same a
suggestion to other group members) on this matter.

Article-I.D.: ns1.1993Apr5.200422.65952
Organization: Lehigh University
Lines: 21

Well, my 14inch VGA 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just
bit the bullet. I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power
light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years.

How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is
the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to
have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from
time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck???

Question: What do I do now???? Buy a new one? Get it fixed? Save up for a
*really* good one and get by with a cheap EGA monitor for now? I rather save
my money to upgrade my 386SX to 486-66 though...

Thanks!

NOW!  The point that I'll try to make is that coincidences like this occur
with a very high frequency.  How many of us have been thinking of someone
and had that person call?  Much of the whole psychic phenomenon is easily
explicable by this - one forgets the misses.  Consider your astrological
forcast in the newspaper.  How many times have you said "That's me" vs
"That's not me"?  You'll remember the hits, but the misses will be much more
frequent.

And what if, instead if being healed, your affliction got much worse and
you ended up paralyzed?  Would you have attributed that to god as well?
Or would that have been the work of satan?  If you believe that would have
been so, why ONLY good from god, and ONLY evil from satan?  Couldn't the
agony have come from god?  Think about what he did to poor Job!

I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science
Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail
proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to
generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at
the meeting. Here goes : 

			The Microlight Solar Sail
			-------------------------

1. Introduction
The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of
sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a
vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.

However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most
people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per
square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized
fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type
spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte
idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.

2.Design
Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a
tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely
be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control
methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a
panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.

The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at
Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data
gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and
communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface
of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of
the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.

3.Missions
The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:
a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor
groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit
rate.
b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved
areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to
reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive
sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that
volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these
locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar
base, BTW]
c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet
nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft
causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged
tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an
ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat
is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300
deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating
container.

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned
examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a
couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not
missing something obvious here...)

Basic Scenario:

	I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of
	files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users 
	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public
	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the
	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The
	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it
	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the
	machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed
	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal
	private keys during the authentication sequence.

Questions:

	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any
	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as
	being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)

	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am
	assisting in "entrapment" (the users would send thier key anyway
	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not
	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?

	Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...

I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positively
the worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on
it when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious
attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in
exactly the same manner..

  1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)
  2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)
  3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles
  4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)
  5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles
  6. Two timing belts.
  7. Constant error signals from computer.

  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging
     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done
     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because
     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4
     weeks to get because it is on national back order. 

     Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new
     design in 87. Parts are very expensive.

No way would I ever buy another Acura. It is highly overrated. .

My understanding of the academic use of the word cult is that it is
a group of people oriented around a single authority figure. It need
not be religious. However, I have seen plenty of religious cults,

Subject: Jose Canseco's Swing - 1992 vs. 1986.
Organization: Julio Machado Candlelight Vigil Society
Distribution: na
Lines: 50

Was going over some videos last night.....

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very
interesting.  And enlightening.

Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,
circa June 1986.

1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,
    not gain more bulk.

2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's
    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.

3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is
    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -
    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,
    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing.

What would I do, if I were Jose?

Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,
so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.

First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this
will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.

Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find
my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling
the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park.

If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could
still hit 600+ HR.

Well put, Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who
live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the
city regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals
play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The
Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in
North America.
As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a
franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown
County Arena.
Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of
Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen
crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e.
the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.
Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without
the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount
of hockey interest exists in the city.

  Your source is wrong.  The double speed CD300 is still slow compared to a
typical hard disk.  The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the
CD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless
you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.

  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster
reading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD,
but only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.

my 12 mile ride(twisties) to work well on the SR500. Costs a bit 
more than the Chengs/IRC's etc, but still less than the Sport

When will people learn!

The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast 
resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to 
store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to 
contact the ballast. 

Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary 
greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in 
fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full 
charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.

If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above 
freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a 
month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, 
DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).

Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like 
electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep 
discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance 
automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure 
shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and 
counting)

4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCE

NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
April 6, 1993

RELEASE:  93-64

        Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology
Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the
Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance
to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space
station.

        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a
high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each
option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,
operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research
operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.

        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA
budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,
station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting
reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station
option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA
budget over the next 5 years.

        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of
the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon
administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the
Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory
committee to consider.

        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have
decided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of
Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.

        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the
redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign
team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR
and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.
The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of
the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing
station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.
Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving
that goal.

        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the
redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the
science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program
represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well
managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should
be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."

        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science
Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald
Sagdeev.

Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good 
as it got for him.

Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know
I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)

Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if
not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.

FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)
   = $80,000 x (1.04)^65
   = just over $1,000,000.

Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.

FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65
   = almost 2,000,000.

(I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).

These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly 
overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above
average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and 
average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t 
think I'm off by much.

Don't be so sure.  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during
World War II.  If you're prepared to say "Let's round these people up and
stick them in a concentration camp without trial", it's only a short step to
gassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originally
only intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly
because they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation
caused by Goering's Total War.  Those who weren't gassed generally died of
malnutrition or disease.

There turned out to be a very simple, conventional explanation for the
phenomenon.  I can't recall the details, but I believe it had to do with
the object between the plates altering the field because of purely
mechanical properties like capacitance.  The "aura" was caused by direct
exposure of the film from variations in field strength.

Well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but

Mr. Hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy.  In short,
an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on
the Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why there
are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution
complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain
on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.

Regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they are
more like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beer
can somebody had thrown on the side of the road: just trash.

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist.
No scientist would take your statement --- "no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome" --- to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out
the catch-22 that if the "crazy" theory were true, you probably couldn't
find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie
beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the
fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---
namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,
many of them appear to get better.  

So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,
controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any
better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject
disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative.  

And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of
people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything
in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do
controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently
sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working
on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also
quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's
completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine
scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting
oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that
doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some
other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be
true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people
have been talking about.

But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal
evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some
candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind
study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

Then by your logic, the Jews in Europe in the 1930's were the cause for

You don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place?

And just what are those actions that you are judging them by?
Their refusal to let the government control their lives? Their refusal
to submit to unconstitutional laws?  Their refusal to behave like
cowards?  Some of Texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way
out too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was
COME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their "OWN CHOICE".  Problem
is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of
insurmountable odds.  But as you point out, they certainly do have
that right.

Bull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed.
The warrant was not issued because they "stockpiled weapons".  It is
not against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in 
Virginia).The warrant was issued for some "gun parts" that are about the size 
of a half-dollar.  Certainly worth the lives of so many people, don't you 
think?

device called the "Toaster" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an
Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and
LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional
photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.

-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --

This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and
LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as
a group.

-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --

Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster
software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.

You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!

-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --

To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain

Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this
point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a
delay in joining.  Expect a "welcome" message within 5 days after you
send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!

-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --

Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the
following address:

        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com

Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This
doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the
opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it
couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address.

NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.

-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --

Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain

I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the
list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you.


-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --

I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store
them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates.

If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI
hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>

I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the
list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past
articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to
the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please
send a mail message to:

        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com

The first command to the server must be "HELP" or "USER name <passwd>".

Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.
Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.
Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.



-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --

Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have
something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to
the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes
some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>

If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact
me at the address:

Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure
from punishing people?  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and
his angels.

To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with
the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible
teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their
judgement is soon to come.

Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory
should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.  Stay away
from human theories, and only take into account references in the bible.

Subject: How to see characterset from wchar_t
Nntp-Posting-Host: emu
Distribution: comp
Organization: Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan
Lines: 137


We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.
The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n
facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's 
X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit
uses Xsi.

Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.
In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed
to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with 
ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t
array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout
and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',
each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.

We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters
from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.

We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used
Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the
source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.


//I18N.h
// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-
// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $

				 int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */
				 char **charset);	/* OUT */
extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);

#endif /* _I18N_H */

					 char*, int*, int*, int*);
    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);
    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);
};

int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */
			  int wc_len,		/* IN */
			  char *buf,		/* OUT */
			  int *buf_len,		/* IN/OUT */
			  int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */
			  char **charset)	/* OUT */
{
    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();
    int ctid;
    int status;
    Charset *xcharset;
    
    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,
				       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);
    if (status == Success) {
	xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));
	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;
    }
    else
	*charset = NULL;
    return status;
}
----------------

An included file above, "Xlocaleint.h", is also Xsi internal and we copied
the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.

A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on
our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.

When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,
link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:
    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)
    _Xmbfscs (code)
    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)
    _XFallBackConvert (code)

We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until
HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that
because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to 
know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used 
its internal functions. 

The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.
We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are
not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and
therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not
seem to lead us a solution.

My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like
'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check
character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?
If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we
want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.

In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery
to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for
the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source 
files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. 
Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.

I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area
even if it is not HP's implementation.

Thank you.

Let's face it, if the words don't get into your noggin in the first place,

Source: Edward K. Boghosian, "Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity
Meeting," The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.

ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,
including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both
Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the 
Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new
Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during
the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And
judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these
political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian
Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.

The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of
the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed
by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the
armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia
(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern
countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to
have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks
of ASALA...

Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian
people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of
the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...
Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement 
was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam 
Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued 
support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, 
pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be 
open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. 
Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that 
his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that
this policy will continue. "The doors of our camps are always open to 
Armenian freedom fighters," he affirmed.

Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son
of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;
two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the
specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of
the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist
party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,
a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the
European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among
those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow
the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.

More than significant was the large number of messages received by the 
organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary
Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation
Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist
Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other
international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.

                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM

Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary
Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction
and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to
foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the
Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will
continue to "reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,"
to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag "Bureau."
The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that
exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,
open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.

The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the
Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.
The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have
turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who
prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc.

 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about "modified,re-published book"
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
              
     
 
> 
>It is not possible that [(*]'s text has 287 pages, mine has 353, and yours has
>377!
 
 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying "it is
 not possible..." ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a "crap"..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many "craps" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

Put the pack on the pillion and bungee it to the backrest.
If that is not possible then you should be able to bungee it behind the

I was in fact going to suggest that Roger take his way of discussion over
to r.s.football.pro. There this kind of hormone-only reasoning is the
standard. Being he canadian, and hockey what it is, I would have suggested
that r.s.h would work too. It is important in a thread that everyone

I would have appreciated an announcement of the policy change - 
Dartmouth will not be able to run xv 3.0, and I'm probably going 
to have to take v2 off line (I somehow missed the "shareware"
designation in the README of v2, and didn't realize that we were
supposed to register).

I also debate whether this, with the new "institutions must pay"
policy belongs in the contrib directory on export - to me, "contrib"
means "contributed" (i.e. no strings, except copyright) attached.

There is also a verse in Luke(?) that says He[Jesus] saw Satan fall

They are also unsupervised.  With proper supervision, they would not be

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million 
Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. 
You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, 
tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

Obviously, we have different sources. Bill Moyers (who happens to be a
theist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his PBS documentary "After The
War" is my main source. (I think I still have it on videotape.) Others
include The Nation and The Progressive.

The rest of the article is mere rationalisation. You may claim that
sanitation plants are strategic "legitimate" targets, but what happens to
the civilians in a city with no sewer system? What happens to the
civilians when you destroy water purification plants? And when hospitals
can't handle the resultant epidemics, because there is no more electricity?

And what exactly are your sources? We have all, I'm sure, seen Postol's
interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about
the Patriot's effectiveness; what is your source for the 70%
effectiveness you claim?

In any case, I don't know if this is relevant to alt.atheism. How about
if we move it somewhere else?

Soderstrom plays with Philly, but he doesn't have a moulded mask.
He's got the helmet and cage variety, in white.  Or at least that's

It's not true.  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its (IDE bus) signal timing
doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing.  My VL-IDE bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3MB/sec up to 8.3MB/
sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3
*milion* byte/sec and 8.3 *milion* byte/sec respectively).   You
cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3MB/sec on the ISA bus.

WHAT??!!!!

You can't remove it, unless you register?  
You gotta be joking, right?
What happens if I get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then
decide that I don't like it.  Do I have to register to be able to get rid
of it?  (Hell, no, that is the last thing I would think of!)
If that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a
statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package!


A better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (IMHO) to allow
anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some
additional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed
to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program.
Of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever
time they like.

Still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That
could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a
specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.


As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions:
Limit the size of data that the program can work with,
Disable saving the data,
Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as
such)
Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started
and/or exited

etc....
but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.

I am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse

but that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in X.
For example, I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2, with point-to-focus
set, and that generally works, but not always, depending on what
was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell
tool window to another.  Or so it seems...

My question, then, is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to-

If you do make it into New York state, the Palisades Interstate Parkway is a
pleasant ride (beautiful scenery, good road surface, minimal traffic).  You
may also want to take a sidetrip along Seven Lakes Drive just off the parkway
for the same reasons plus the road sweeps up and down along the hills with

Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the 
same year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out
with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will
come up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system, 
and the numbers ended up closer.  And then you've got the media types in their

Well, that's the obvious conclusion, given your train of logic.  The

This may be the root of the confusion...

Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  Note
that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the
question at hand.

Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10
and win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population
of people who play this game every week.

In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population
will win 7 or more times.

In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again
be 7-time winners.

In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in
each of the first two years will win 7 again.

Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three
years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last
three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.

Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?
No.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these
"consistent winners" can influence their chances of winning.  But
suppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill
might be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are
psychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?

We can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the
population will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a
high positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics,
they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net
result?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.

>This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having
>with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical

Well, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has
hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at
the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse
as they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn't
seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be
clutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*
streak to be different from past streaks?

Now if it were true that "75% of all three-year streaks remained true
to form", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn't
have zero correlation.  Instead we have "50% of all three-year streaks
remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse".  You
look at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more
likely to choke this year".  But it would be equally valid to look at
those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to
be clutch this year", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each
way.

>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find
>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent
>basis? 

Then we would have something useful.  And we would also have a
positive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a
pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern
and then reverses.

Cheers,
-Valentine

Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often
explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in
contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus
('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and
implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of
language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's
thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary
framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features
remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being
transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving
us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own
account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that
any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to
talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but
a threshold.
  vonWrights's comment that Witt's "sentences have a content that often lies
deep beneath the surface of language."  On the surface, Witt talks of the
insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing
ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with
Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes
in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more
perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it
is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to
offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his
Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse
of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. 
Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about
our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.

  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in
it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of
understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of "as a man thinketh, so
he is."  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,
that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals
of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that
there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too
are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the
individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to
Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the
one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the
Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has
the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not
only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things
of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep
things of GOd that are absolute and true.
   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced
and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because
if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.

Hi Stephen
Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing
a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the
external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some 
hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your
own, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and
fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen
peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)
and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  
firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the
tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl 
under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy
a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever
you may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse
it out.
Good Luck

  the labour is not so expensive, they can afford to put decent
  components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the
  amplifier - as Adcom has done.

Sure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the
  amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to
  the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.
I don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that
  the amp is doing nothing :)
The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
  skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below
  and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.

My opinions once again.

Gregg, so would you consider that Rushdie would now be left alone,

Sealing off the Gaza Strip has the interesting side-effect of
demonstrating the non-viability of Gaza as an independent state.
Where are all of these people going to go to find work if they are

To anyone with experience about Honda Civic (EX or DX) or Saturn SL1:

I would be interested in knowing how reliable these cars are, how expensive
they are to own and operate (parts, maintenance, gas, insurance), if the
dealers are good, and if they actually live up to their economy image.

Another question:  what would I expect to pay for a Civic EX coupe with

I wouldn't worry too much about it, though.  We are starting to find
out how politically impotent homosexuals really are.  The Colorado
boycott has fizzled, Slick Willie was effectively prevented from
implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his
_OWN_ party, this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their
claims of large numbers, and coming this Saturday they are going to
wind up with _TREMENDOUS_ egg on their face when, I submit, no more
than perhaps 35,000 queers will show up in Washington while they are
promising crowds in the millions.  And most of the ones who will be
there will look like ACT-UP and Queer Nation, not the guy working in
the next cubicle.  As if that's really going to play in middle
America.

Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
where they belong.

There are many cases, but I do not remeber names.  The Isralis shot and killed
a UN observer in Gaza in the first half of Intifada.

I believe that most of the world has seen pictures of Israeli soldiers who
were breaking the cameras of the reporters, kicking reporters out, confiscating
cassettes, and showing reporters militery orders preventing them from going
to hot areas to pick pictures and make reports.

There is a (likely) veto proof majority in the house.  The Senate,
unfortunately, is a different story.  The Lt.Gov. has vowed that the bill will
not be voted on, and he has the power to do it.  In addition, the Senate is a
much smaller, and more readily manipulated body.

On ther other hand, the semi-automatic ban will likely not live, as at least
fifty per cent of the house currently opposes it, and it is VERY far down in
the bill order in the Senate (I believe it will be addressed after the CCW
bill).

And I thought my TX Political Science class was a waste of time!

You can't knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying 
the threads.  Also part of the stud would still be in the hole. 
Therefore the stud was *not* in the hole before you touched something 
down on that side of the bike.

I'd use a secret (nope, obscure) cryptographic encoding to expand the 
30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block. The redundancy hereby introduced 
can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy 
replaced the L.E. block by random data. 

And of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption 
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must 
be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. 

For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing 
a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding 
it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies 
of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption 
algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the 
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and 
it will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting 
faulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own 
safety ;-(. 

The `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed 
for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents 
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the 
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks 
within the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as 
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.

So don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the 
tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks 
than those suggested above. Of course it's absolutely crucial that the 
algorithms (and protocols) remain secret. Personally I doubt they will.

The BDs was warned in beforehand about the FBI action. They HAD the chance to

Many thanks to those who responded to my question.  Unfortunately I have
had no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested
in geting one, and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
that description.  This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of 
Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the 
early part of the century.  This may take me some time to do (in my
limited spare time) but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested, 
when it is ready.

The responses I received are summerised below:

Kevin Donnelly (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mentioned that Michael Everson
(everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts
for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me.  I contacted Michael
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh, and
that he will eventually port them to the PC, but that he will be charging 
IR 100 (about $160) for each one.

pbryant@ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a
'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them'.  These are "Durrow" and "American 
Uncial-Normal".  I don't know where you can get these but I don't
think that they have the effects I am looking for.

Finally, rhiannon@netcom.com (Rhia) mentioned that the "Meath" font
included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package
is very much like what I was describing.  I faxed Casady & Greene for
info but got no reply.

So that's it.  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available.

Meeting of the UK Cryptoprivacy Association
- -------------------------------------------

Saturday, 8 May 1993, 1500

To be held at the offices of:

  FOREST
  4th floor
  2 Grosvenor Gardens
  London  SW1W 0DH

This is located at the corner of Hobart Place, a couple of
blocks west of Victoria Station, and almost directly across from
the dark green cabbie shelter.

If you have trouble finding the place, please call the office on
071-823-6550.  Or, call me (Russell Whitaker) on my pager,
081-812-2661, and leave an informative message with the
telephone number where you can be reached; I will return the
call almost immediately.

Discussion will range from the usual general topics, such as the
use of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data, to
specific topics, such as recent moves by the U.S. government
to restrict choice in data privacy (reference recent discussion
on Usenet groups, e.g. sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp).

All are invited.  Particularly welcome are members of the
newly-formed UK CommUnity group ... the local
EFF-in-spirit-if-not-in-name folks.

Those who plan to attend should email me and let me know.
Please.

All attendees are requested to bring diskettes - preferably
MS-DOS - with their PGP 2.+ public keys.  As is usual at these
gatherings, several of us will bring our laptops, and will sign
public keys, subject to the usual caveats (reference the
documentation for PGP 2.2, specifically files PGPDOC1.DOC and
PGPDOC2.DOC).

If you do not already have a copy of PGP 2.2 (MS-DOS), and would
like to have a copy of this public domain program, please bring
a formatted, medium or high density 3.5 inch floppy PC diskette;
you will be provided a copy of the program.

Of course, you might prefer to ftp a version of the program from
one of the various archive sites.  I suggest trying Demon
Internet Systems, which carries the full range of PGP (Phil
Zimmerman's "Pretty Good Privacy") implementations: directory
/pub/pgp at gate.demon.co.uk.

Meetings are of indeterminate time.  Those who are interested
are invited to join the rest of us at a pseudorandomly
determined pub afterwards.

Please note:
- ------------
In the past few months, interested people have emailed me,
requesting FAQs and special information mailings.  I regret
that, except in very unusual cases (e.g. working press), I
cannot, in a timely manner, respond to these requests.  I will,
however - and for the first time - do a writeup of this meeting,
which I will post in various places.

What I *am* willing to supply is general information on our
activities for the maintainers of existing FAQs, such as that
for alt.privacy.  FAQ maintainers can contact me at
whitaker@eternity.demon.co.uk

++++++++++++++++++++++++ CAR AMPLIFIERS FOR SALE +++++++++++++++++++++++++

I have 3 high-end car amplifiers for sale:

(2) Old-Style Rockford Fosgate 150's.  These are great amps, and I've never
    had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on
    high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased
    with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and
    they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell
    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already
    own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked
    in cars.

    I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was
    $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come
    down on the price a little bit.


(1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,
    and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.
    This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into
    2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end
    before where it did very well.

    I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on
    it.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new
wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print
GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer
(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not
possible).

This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to
Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It
is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.

SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour
version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the
'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it
gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).

There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older
computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been
upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal
with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult 
time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).

Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT
Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to
do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300
is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).

  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY
  
  "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.
  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.
  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and

  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for

Subject: Re: SSPX schism ?

Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in
general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around
1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous
activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all
that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.

Joe Buehler

...

Schism and Disobedience

According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a
refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the
Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever
the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he
must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to
the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of
jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it
clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of
disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the
beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American
bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.

The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in
the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de
Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is
certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism
and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father
Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence
of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection
of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a
decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not
constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia
explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to
intend "to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies."  It
adds that "not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this
character it must include besides the transgression of the command of
the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command."Not only
does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,
but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and
his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made
his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: "We pray
for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations
last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II
the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he
is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor
heresy."

...

Intrinsically Schismatic?

The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in
schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is
an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a
consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is
not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it
would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917
Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see
Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to
excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic
church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops
differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre
as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,
that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the
illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise
an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the
bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of
jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of
ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and
also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way
the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of
bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the
ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the
primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman
Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the
Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in
response.

It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics
that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican
has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not
so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of
Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled
"Penalties for Specific Offenses" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The
first part deals with "Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the
Church" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon
1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together
with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses
against the unity of the Church.

But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this
canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against
religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his
excommunication comes from the third section of "Penalties for
Specific Offenses" which is entitled "Usurpation of Ecclesial
Functions and Offenses in their Exercise" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum
Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is
Canon 1382, which reads: "A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and
the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a
pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)
excommunication reserved to the Holy See."

The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense
of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable
smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly
justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate
parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had
been convicted of first degree murder.

I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion
of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers
without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated
the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father
Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut
Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs
actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not
excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical
function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which
constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the
illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of
the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a
parallel Church.

Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the
Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations
in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to
imagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:

    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not
    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with
    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses
    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are
    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a
    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the
    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the
    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh
    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated
    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because
    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.

....

It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating
bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least
intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and
will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that
the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,
and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to
consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon
Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that
the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these
consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it
could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred
excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates
as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot
expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a
great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to
the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.

Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce
Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he
knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no
greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and
the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a
statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February
1989 Remnant merits careful study:

    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June
    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also
    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist "obstinancies." And from the
    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to
    present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense
    against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has "an
    erroneous concept of Tradition." If this were so, Cardinal
    Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the
    Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987:
    "Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it
    'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to
    the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern
    and shares it."

Keywords: Motorola, FPU, 68882, 68030, 33/50 MHz, problems (FPU exception)

I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz
68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously
a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the
systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for
the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works
fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer
of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)
might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some
suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications
problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?
Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought
that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). 
Are there any MC68882RC33?

Thanks

Subject: Clipper -- some new thoughts
Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories
Lines: 55

I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments
that went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for
sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since
the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.

I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my
followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your
feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an
80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less
acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one
repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper
would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out
in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.
A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,
and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,
neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant
to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect
the subkeys even more.

Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of
the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be
their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'
public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session
keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have
to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This
would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you
make sure they stop''.

We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back
door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record
of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to
the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of
the warrant.

I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100
public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need
more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be
used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;
the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very
long.

I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from
the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the
back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned
about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This
scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard
rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with
DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it
was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping
the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations
without the back door.

The cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no valid
reasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- there
are a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.

Well, where is he?  Another false Messiah shot down in flames.

Matthew 24:4
   "Watch out that no one deceives you.  For many will come in my
    name, claiming, 'I am the Christ', and will deceive many."

Matthew 24:23
   "At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'
    or 'There he is!' do not believe it.  For false Christs and 
    false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles
    to deceive even the elect - if that were possible.  See, I have
    told you ahead of time."

Do we listen?  Sadly, not all of us do.

Peace be with you, and condolences to the families of those lost at

I would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is
output from a thermocouple, preferably by a factor of
100 or 1000 ---- so that the resulting voltage can be fed
more easily into a personal-computer-based ADC data
acquisition card.

Might anyone be able to point me to references to such
circuits?  I have seen simple amplifier circuits before, but
I am not sure how well they work in practice.

In this case, I'd like something which will amplify sufficiently
"nicely" to be used for thermocouples (say, a few degrees
accuracy or better).

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!

That doesn't count as getting rid of the press.  Getting rid of the press

"Muslim" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not
all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?)
exist in ex-Yugoslavia "Christian Muslims."  Tito defined the Muslim 
nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,
the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
end of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:
Montenegrins, and Makedonijans. 

Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, "Muslim"
is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who 
differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not 
a "Christo-Slavic" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it
was the "Atheist Communist" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was
no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.  

The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
instead of pens.  The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all*
chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.

      REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING DATABASES 
                             VIA THE INTERNET
 
NASA is planning to expand the domain of users of its Earth and space science
data.  This effort will:
 
  o   Use the evolving infrastructure of the U.S. Global Change Research 
      Program including the Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) and the Earth 
      Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Programs.
 
  o   Use the Internet, particularly the High Performance Computing and 
      Communications Program's NREN (National Research and Education 
      Network), as a means of providing access to and distribution of 
      science data and images and value added products.
 
  o   Provide broad access to and utilization of remotely sensed images in 
      cooperation with other agencies (especially NOAA, EPA, DOE, DEd, 
      DOI/USGS, and USDA). 
 
  o   Support remote sensing image and data users and development 
      communities. 
 
The user and development communities to be included (but not limited to) as
part of this effort are educators, commercial application developers (e.g., 
television weather forecasters), librarians, publishers, agriculture 
specialists, transportation, forestry, state and local government planners, and
aqua business.
 
This program will be initiated in 1994.  Your assistance is requested to 
identify potential applications of remote sensing images and data.  We would 
like your ideas for potential application areas to assist with development of
the Implementation Plan.
 
PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  
 
We are seeking your ideas in these areas: 
 
  (1)  Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images; 
 
  (2)  Potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in 
       education (especially levels K-12) and other noncommercial areas;
 
  (3)  Types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data more 
       accessible;
 
  (4)  Additional points of contacts for ideas; and 
 
  (5)  Addresses and names  from whom to request proposals.

Reply-To: buzz@bear.com (Buzz Moschetti)

(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
"regular" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a "proper" way
to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow "tickle" the
Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.

What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman-style
player.  He plays hard at all times, doesn't disregard his defensive
responsibilities and is a good leader.  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his
ice time.

Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a "me first" attitude.
This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.

Throughout the year, Francis consistently recieved more ice time than
Jagr.  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject, I am pretty
sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.  When
you add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident
that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

Moreover, the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound, and as
far as I have been able to ascertain, those agents were still in the
compound when the first shots were fired.  For all we know, these two
people may BE the agents, who would certainly be unlikely to stay around
and "cook" with the faithful...

Assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all.

Maybe I sound paranoid, but I watched Janet Reno last night harping on
how much David Koresh was a big, bad child abuser, and I kept wondering 
why she -- much less BATF -- wanted us to infer that she had any 
jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place.

I'm POSITIVE that the "sealed warrant" is not for child abuse.  What was
it for?  Peobably weapons violations.  Janet Reno didn't say WORD ONE
last night about weapons violations.  Why?  Because she knows that such
a case is no longer believable?

The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the
primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image
processing software that much faster. When they use the _same_ deconvolution 
software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some 
incredible results!  There is every reason to believe that the results will 
_exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.  

Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works 
realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.  You might be
interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in
the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.  Starting on page 52 of the 
April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product.
It lists for $1,290.  The article states: "The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System 
comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry 
around."  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest
objects, "it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter
in the telescope's focal plane."  Now just imagine how well this infant 
technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that 
has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its
development.

The majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps.
There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have control
of NI, like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump (I was
appalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast). It is my
understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water --
it'd be quite a problem if NI got its independence from Britain and
then stopped accepting the waste. Are you suggesting that British
industry isn't making profit off the situation as well?

How does that qualify?
Indeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance.
I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as
"accepted uncritically," especially the few that are legend.
Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but
they don't meet the other criterions.
Also...

>Divine justice. According to the most fundamental doctrines of

You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to
launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the
requirements of myth.)

>salvation. The idea of punishment is based on the proposition that
>everyone knows (instinctively?) that God exists, is their creator and

Ah, but not everyone "knows" that god exists.  So you have
a fallacy.

And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy?
Read the FAQ.  If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read.
(Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)

...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting
it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn't
make it any more credible to me.

If the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason
to doubt the Bible, because not everyone "knows" your alleged
god's alleged existance.

1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far
from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;
it is only a proof that some people have thought that there
was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been
writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the
case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the
only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it.
And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the
interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.

2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.

3) Again, read the FAQ.

>freedom. You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to
>ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known

Bzzt...wrong answer!
Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and
rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the
other hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except
on the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence.
Gravity is obvious; gods aren't.

>Secondly, human reason is very comforatble with the concept of God, so
>much so that it is, in itself, intrinsic to our nature. Human reason

No, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of
"God"; it has usually come back to the existance of "god".
In other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian
god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much
of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as
the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces
are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view,
human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to
be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural
tendancy to believe in "God" only exists in religious wishful
thinking.

>I said all this to make the point that Christianity is eminently
>reasonable, that Divine justice is just and human nature is much
>different than what atheists think it is. Whether you agree or not

Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and
it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence.
Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already
believe in the divinity.
First, not all atheists believe the same things about human
nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not,
YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at
the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric
approach.  Try looking at the outside world as well when
you attempt to sum up all of humanity.

rather than the person doing the pushing, as (a) dolphins are not usually
aggressive and (b) they seem to have well-developed brains and a capacity for
abstract thought.

As a matter of fact, tigers rarely attack humans unless the human provokes
them.  Of course, if they are in a cage which is far too small, that might
count as provocation...

Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge
and an "object". The jealousy does not technically exist until the object
is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there
even though it is not detectable.

Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but
I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions
can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to
define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of
each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is
easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I
misunderstood?

My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and
his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do
my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)
is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this
will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the
list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his
transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what
gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.

I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:

I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions
in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of
the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a
graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of
frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the
spectrum over time.

Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the
reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature
because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with
Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the
urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,
I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why
Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is "what
provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?". I think I need some
more time with this one.

That's about it for now!

David.

Subject: Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer for sale
Originator: rob@snoopy.msc.cornell.edu
Organization: cluttered-but-in-order
Lines: 71


Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer:
I have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance
oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because
it has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more "digital".
Below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:
  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of
    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo
    panning for each voice
  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different
    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds
  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source
  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has
    access to all eight voices
  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight
    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity
    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.
  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of 
    modulation sources and routings.
  o A 3.5" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks
    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to
    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot
    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.
  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device
  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly "page-driven"
    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface
  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening
  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1
    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on
    the SQ-80.

This SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while
now.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily
used sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed
with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer
(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.

>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped
short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves
are processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80
is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.
Simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most
good analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it
works very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.
This SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have
an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain
to use so I have avoided it.

REASON FOR SALE:
I am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual
here in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a
powerful but economical master keyboard.

PRICING AND TERMS:
I paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept
$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of 
patches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the 
original Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.

Price:    Asking $650.00 (everything)
Shipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states

There is also the question of cause and effect.
Lock a mostly straight guy up for 10 years with only guys, ask
ten years later if he has ever had sex with a guy. Closing your
eyes and pretending its a girl sucking you still counts as sex
with a guy on the survey....

As a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he
should abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience
forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate
this system of government-sanctioned slavery.

If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY)
and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia),
we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by
improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending,
but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the 
infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)

A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing
decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper
than building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the 
most appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in
my lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates
or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the
money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt.

Could you use some sort of mechanical chest compression as an aid.
Sorta like the portable Iron Lung?   Put some sort of flex tubing
around the 'aquanauts' chest.  Cyclically compress it  and it will
push enough on the chest wall to support breathing?????

You'd have to trust your breather,  but in space, you have to trust

Close. My mother comes from Gainesville Tex, right across the border.
They claim to be the chigger capitol of the world, and I believe them.
When I grew up in Fort Worth it was bad enough, but in Gainesville

This effect disappears if you clean your apparatus after you kirlianed

Well, in the latest Windows magazine, there is an advertisement for a program
that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk (Uninstaller)
but it can be used to update a network, but only for deleting, not adding
or changing their *.ini files.  (Uninstaller, by MicroHelp Inc.  $79

I am also looking for an *.ini updater for my PC network, and so far without
any luck.  So for the time being I have been pushing DOS and it's batch
language to its limit...look into DOS 5.0's (I am assumming that DOS 6.0
has the same command, maybe even more..or less..improved) REPLACE command.
I use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch
file that is run everytime they invoke Windows.  This basically overwrites
their color schemes, but does what I need it to do.  Not neat, but does
the job...I'm looking for a better solution though.

I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for 
the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to
all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made
obsolete by Jesus.

If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the
following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He
also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived
interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their
heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness
must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom
of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their
way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.
They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the
letter of the Law but never really believed in it.  

I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of
modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?

Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's
perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.
Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their
choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

God be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

That's really sad when two second-rate goalies (Barasso and Belfour)
are the main contenders for the Vezina. Call me crazy, but how about
Tommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't
really play defense. It's really unfortunate that the better goalies
in the league (McLean, Essensa, Vernon) had unspectacular years. BTW,
if you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last 30 days,
why not give the Vezina to Moog? He has been the best goalie over the
past month.

Arbour or King. Burns will probably win, since playoffs aren't taken
into consideration - he's OK in the regular season, but I'm not sure
if he's beaten anyone other than Hartford in the playoffs.

______________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                             April 23, 1993     

	     
                  PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
	     
	     
                            The East Room 


1:00 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the 
Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, 
anything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering 
taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery 
sites?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for 
more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for 
further action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three 
months.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and 
we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on 
enforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes 
investigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace 
process.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much 
tougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National 
Security Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on 
implementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.
	     
	     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should 
act.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led 
for the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be 
fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And 
they have troops on the ground there.
	     
	     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, 
nor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think 
we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and 
which has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the 
administration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I 
think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a 
policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.
	     
	     Q	  Can I follow up?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole 
different level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human 
history.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of 
inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of 
moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely 
because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is 
especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic 
groups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have 
to stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.
	     
	     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in 
that region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and 
the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making 
progress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and 
the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other 
conflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of 
the region.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a 
good week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of 
your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong 
and what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  
Are you reassessing?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the 
situation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I 
don't know that the administration could have made it different.
	     
	     On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the 
larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already 
fundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We 
have abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies 
that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion 
in only a decade.  
	     
	     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will 
reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low 
in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are 
probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages 
in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  
That's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this 
economy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we 
are moving in the right direction economically.
	     
	     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have 
begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the 
administration, but people in the Congress whether there is something 
I could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it 
didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  
There are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I 
just disagree with that.  
	     
	     I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been 
underway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-
percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having 
trouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an 
argument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates 
and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years 
to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go 
forward.
	     
	     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a 
majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted 
for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and 
voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I 
just misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just 
been here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a 
contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get 
political reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I 
basically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days 
with regard to the Congress.
	     
	     Q	  Waco --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have 
much to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the 
situation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any 
insights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole 
thing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from 
the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do 
not think the United States government is responsible for the fact 
that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry 
that they killed their children.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your 
stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross 
Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people 
in your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus 
package.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign 
against the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going 
to handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts 
on the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage 
some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to 
resubmit them to the Hill?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  
We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going 
to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can 
do about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found 
that rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. 
Perot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I 
would -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a 
remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, 
we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  
But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  
	     
	     So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if 
maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and 
he has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.
	     
	     Q	  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his 
political criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you 
think you can sit back and just --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to 
apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's 
changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last 
year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's 
got some constructive ideas.  
	     
	     I think the American people have shown that they're very 
impatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one 
thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- 
even if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get 
something done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to 
do things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my 
judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is 
constructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will 
change people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that 
ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this 
debate and not just to the President.

	     Q	  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  
You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a 
criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many 
options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of 
paralysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why 
is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act 
unilaterally?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you 
would agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining 
superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some 
mandate of the United Nations.

	     Q	  But you have a mandate and --

	     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things 
that we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for 
action.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, 
except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the 
introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  
We are not.  

	     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would 
remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the 
British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  
They have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have 
supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They 
welcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to 
make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And 
I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely 
reassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we 
can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where 
we have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French 
and others about that.
	     
	     Q	  Would that be military action?
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in 
your administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. 
Ambassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services 
Secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which 
are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in 
your administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political 
grip?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. 
	     
	     Q	  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no 
child abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's 
newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of 
these are things you said that you didn't support.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we 
know that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is 
undisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where 
I come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had 
people teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that 
qualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I 
don't know exactly what he said.
	     
	     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has 
made no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press 
report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed 
her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new 
direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior 
members of my administration to let me know what they thought we 
ought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about 
what they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss 
the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I 
make a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going 
to do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies 
speaking out of school.
	     
	     Q	  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?
	     
	     Q	  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala 
both said that they thought that that was a good idea.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's 
a good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy 
grounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it 
in the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I 
have no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had 
a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they 
thought that tax would help make their particular industries more 
competitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a 
line against an administration policy.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and 
lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed 
in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of 
them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would 
fulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to 
meet their now enhanced expectations?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I 
don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  
But I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies 
should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe 
when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country 
that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and 
compelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of 
our people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a 
political proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 
when I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.
	     
	     And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been 
attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily 
coming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I 
was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights 
of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to 
practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have 
always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect 
the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest 
of their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.
	     
	     Q	  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated 
expectations on their end and criticism among others that has 
hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis 
on this issue?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal 
of emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters 
and in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to 
see it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my 
time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, 
and that's what I'll continue to do.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in 
Bosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on 
new options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most 
commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable 
the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited 
air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us 
your decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on 
those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going 
through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final 
decision?  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There 
are -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options 
that have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have 
supporters and opponents within the administration and in the 
Congress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be 
required to embark on any new policy.
	     
	     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the 
pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military 
action, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes 
action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We 
must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The 
United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a 
war.  
	     
	     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the 
question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to 
fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will 
it lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have 
that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?
	     
	     But I think both of them deserve some serious 
consideration, along with some other options we have.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think that these people who are trying to 
get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't 
taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and 
we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from 
Vietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for 
treatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of 
these wars?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument 
against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent 
in a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  
We do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of 
systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could 
have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and 
goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other 
practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts 
of ethnic tensions exist.

	     Q	  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris 
Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive 
action against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has 
his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and 
he did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly 
enough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President 
Yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher 
sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper 
decision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the 
rest of the free world very much appreciated. 

	     Q	  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more 
involved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you 
handle that situation differently now?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that 
the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds 
of things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come 
out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and 
answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions 
we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And 
I look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did 
before, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once 
we knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military 
be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the 
conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and 
their obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before 
the action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I 
have reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were 
sufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to 
make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should 
have asked.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director 
Sessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on 
his future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing 
before you do decide?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment 
of his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no 
negative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand 
by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And 
I'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what 
to do with the direction of the FBI.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, since you said that one side in 
Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to 
the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot 
take a partisan view in this war?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of 
ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That 
does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter 
a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of 
republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately 
be successful.
	     
	     I think what the United States has to do is to try to 
figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the 
people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop 
ethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are 
wrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy 
problem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were 
easy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to 
do more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly 
not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now 
looking at what else we can do.
	     
	     Q	  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt 
administration for not having bombed the railroads to the 
concentration camps and things that were near military targets.  
Aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct 
conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that 
the circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with 
Germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --
series of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've 
got all of our options under review.
	     
	     Q	  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge 
of collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale 
military operation?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  
That's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and 
Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps 
going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the 
de facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  
They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the 
first place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to 
power.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we 
discuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're 
going to prevail there and be successful.  
	     
	     I do believe that there's every reason to think that 
there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to 
guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on 
both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of 
ongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail 
there.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, would you care to make your 
assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of 
all, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the 
biggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration 
and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both 
bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do 
it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of 
which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing 
a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the 
middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were 
going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the 
total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.
	     
	     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. 
We have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of 
billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people 
refinance their debt.  
	     
	     We have established a new environmental policy, which is 
dramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with 
me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach 
in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing 
opportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political 
reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed 
tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  
These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the 
campaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is 
heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal 
government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens 
of this country.  
	     
	     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The 
welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, 
of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care 
issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for 
millions of Americans.  
	     
	     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More 
will be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of 
the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to 
me yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  
So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  
I feel good about it.
	     
	     Q	  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that 
one of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now 
practically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own 
country, how can we do it for them?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  
It's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be 
fair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of 
aid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is 
plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we 
agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the 
international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is 
plainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more 
aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States 
Congress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be 
resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American 
workers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will 
be tied by many members of Congress.

	     Q	  The tailhook report came out this morning, 
documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the 
Navy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done 
about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  
The Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and 
which has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to 
be acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the 
American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for 
what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to 
be thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general 
indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who 
serve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be 
pursued.  

	     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the 
Navy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I 
expected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he 
will do that.

	     Q	  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  
The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of 
confidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not 
voters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  

	     Q	  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you 
live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in 
order to then build support for Russian aid?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question 
is, for the United States, the key question should be that which is 
posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins 
the election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as 
their President, then I think we should do our best to work with him 
toward reform.
	     
	     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the 
Holocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from 
Eastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former 
Soviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they 
convert from a communist command and control economy to a market 
economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And 
in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all 
leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll 
because they haven't produced the results that the people so 
earnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  
	     
	     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think 
that's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian 
people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the 
United States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a 
genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I 
think that we should support that.

	     Q	  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in 
what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --
NAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement 
and when do you expect to see it accomplished?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready 
in the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working 
with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side 
agreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental 
agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what 
the fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  
	     
	     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their 
position, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty 
in enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United 
States, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --
about giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an 
environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means 
something, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for 
violating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an 
approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --
if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an 
isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be 
some enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out 
the details of that.
	     
	     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just 
an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think 
that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more 
closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us 
from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and 
gives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only 
way a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and 
other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own 
region, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry 
about how to build those bridges in our own area.  
	     
	     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot 
of questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every 
one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you 
know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for 
this, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things 
honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong 
about the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not 
self-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for 
President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating 
these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  
So I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept 
of NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the 
details needed to be improved.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of 
interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to 
show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General 
Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was 
authentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal 
view at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you 
believe that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American 
prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey 
before he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high 
regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country 
in this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let 
me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it 
had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to 
undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.
	     
	     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are 
having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the 
evaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the 
families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I 
think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of 
the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last 
interchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know 
all that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't 
know the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I 
was encouraged by the last trip.
	     
	     Q	  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. 
normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be 
personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be 
willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to 
resolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to 
us to confirm good faith?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never 
resolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases 
for them and that there are still some cases that have not been 
factually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I 
would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward 
resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, 
and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to 
continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving 
those cases.  And we're not there yet.  
	     
	     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who 
know a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily 
influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, 
or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and 
the other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am 
very influenced by how the families feel.
	     
	     Q	     your economic stimulus package, are you doing 
some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, 
your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, 
the health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to 
do that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob 
Dole?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent 
to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly 
after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, 
including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when 
we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 
billion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for 
supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at 
least four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated 
that.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  
	     
	     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to 
negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, 
every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had 
previously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a 
strange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a 
significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired 
a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so 
that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, "Mr. 
President, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all 
strung out and we're divided."  
	     
	     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, 
what I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want 
to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and 
Republicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to 
make it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not 
the President and the administration.  The real losers were the 
hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could 
have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could 
have done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is 
very, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  
But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --
that it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.
	     
	     Q	     and redo --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you 
mentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to 
pass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point 
of passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady 
Bill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country 
just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we 
have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a 
waiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that 
we need more police officers on the street.  
	     
	     That's another thing that -- I really believe that once 
we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this 
jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the 
street who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean 
people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. 
I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a 
second.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's 
senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior 
officers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated 
in this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las 
Vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a 
right to know the names of the senior officers?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of 
law which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now 
an Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I 
were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which 
might be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think 
all I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed 
by the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I 
want appropriate action to be taken.  
	     
	     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and 
appropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am 
the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so 
as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action 
might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or 
con.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing 
handled in an appropriate and thorough way.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification 
on Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of 
American forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground 
forces, sir?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.
	     
	     Q	  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if 
you fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States 
into a ground war there?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our 
evaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never 
been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of 
ground forces into an ongoing conflict there.
	     
	     Q	  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington 
this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to 
leave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way 
participating in some of the activities? 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No.
	     
	     Q	  Why not?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't 
participate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on 
balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should 
be done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me 
to make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental 
issues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will 
say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, 
asking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, 
basically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be 
treated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  
And that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will 
be here, but for others as well.  
	     
	     Thank you very much.

Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the
biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the
modern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That
Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no
reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of
resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what
the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work 
_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ
Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul
here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there
is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,
no ascension either.

Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the
grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts
until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up
with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,
I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts
before this which mention the tomb).

You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the

I aint talking the large or even the "mining companies" I am talking the small
miners, the people who have themselves and a few employees (if at all).The
people who go out every year and set up thier sluice box, and such and do
mining the semi-old fashion way.. (okay they use modern methods toa point).

I am talking the guy who coem to Nome evry year, sets up his tent on the beach
(the beach was washed away last year) and sets up his/her sluice box and goes
at it "mining".
I know the large corps, such as Alaska Gold Company, might complain to..

My opinions are what I learn at the local BS table..

My original thing/idea was that the way to get space mining was to allow the
eco-freaks thier way.. As they have done with other mineral development.

The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,
and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,
the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined
with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:
"Ctrl Any<Key>q".

This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using
event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If
you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics
changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the
documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's
expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as
translations.

>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?

If you mean "menu accelerator", no it's not possible.  That's according to
the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.

>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you

I can't think of a reason why not.

>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of

There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu
accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators
resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's
accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with
XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).

For example,

  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade
					  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton
							  - exitPushbutton

  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O
  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O
  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q
  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q

  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\
    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\
    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)

You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you
can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then
XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.

I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I
used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators
on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead
of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I
described above should work.

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.

>I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P

Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

There are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very
wide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal.
No private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve ...
and as our private sector has discovered, they're better off not
offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use.

The alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out,
doctors opted out, or both).  But that only for insurance ... and you
can't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they
will not offer.  And remember that the actual health care is delivered
by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.
Again, they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.

Plus, there is the matter of culture and values ... I'm basically
anti-tax and anti-government, by Canadian standards ... yet I can't
bring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that I
understand where you're coming from.  Up north, you're so much more
likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health
insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...

In Canada and Germany, it's not mandatory.  However, it is negative

sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option

Yes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are
too small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so
you pretty well have to be a GP to get paid.  And if you do get
the training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a
licence because there is already someone in the business and who
cannot fill his/her appointment book.  That we have a CMA doctors
monopoly is something that the American AMA-oriented medical lobby
NEVER tells you down here ...

No, I respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my MD friends
are (-;) but there's the question of our small market dynamics up
north ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell
their services to Americans to generate more business will inflate
their effective population served, and thus make some specialties
finally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  We just do
not have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.

Uh ... Germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness
funds.  The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're
all interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in
our German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in
Saarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes
by province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations
and regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have
the same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have
public health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities
(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra
insurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,
was one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).

Remember, the Germans don't have HMO's ... a telling sign, 'cos
Rochester does and they're also a company town.

I'll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim, but
I've come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about
our "system".  If much or some of it were true, you'd have to take
us for idiots for tolerating it.  And given that our insurance was
installed during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory
governments federally and provincially, and the socialists are still
chafing, they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix
things ... think about it.  After all, we are using the U.S. as a
metric to make comparison ... both for keeping-up-with-the-Joneses
as for confirming that we did something right.

	Hello,

	I remember running across an ad in the back of Mac[User|World]
a few years ago, for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots, to be
used to "recycle your old SIMMs," when you upgraded memory.  I don't
remember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised in
any of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included software
to make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS 
he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly
good idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?  
Are they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used one
if they are no longer made?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please
e-mail me, to save net.bandwidth.


	Thanks,

Yes and No. ESPN2 will be launched as early in September. Cap Cities
are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up
base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service.

The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the
merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks. Prime SportsChannel
will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season. Also,TCI
and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
country with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will
do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the
NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC
and ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime
SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams.

Hi,

I've got a Victor PC/XT with a 20 MB harddisk in it. The controller is
a Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.

There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wires
and another with 34 wires.

The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire
bus.

Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether
I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room
for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)

How can I solve my problem, any suggestions?

So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is
if it contradicts the Quran?  What if it relates to something
that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran?

Also, the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed
either.  It wasn't long after, but 20 years or so is still long
enough to shift a few verses around.

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1, and GCC).
  DEC Ultrix.
  DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1).

Documentation is available online.

Changes since 0.13 include:

 o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Sun's that
   coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
   their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
   themselves. 
 o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. 
 o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
 o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient
   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. 
 o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document
   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
   they're placed). 
 o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). 
 o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
 o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. 
 o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not
   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
   in any case). 
 o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A
   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. 
 o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. 
 o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'.

Does the addition of compression then encrypting make the cyphertext

Would running crypt after DES provide greater data privacy?  Is it

Marvin Minsky (hi there) writes of building "perceptrons?" in the 1950s using
motor-driven potentiometers to vary the weights. He reported that the circuits
worked even tho there were wiring errors. (Can you say ROBUST?)

Cadium Sulfide cells vary with light. CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID
somewhat-linear-yet-somewhat-limiter transfer function often used. 
Low power Schottky gates, and earlier gates, has about a gain of X8.
LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells, even at a
few mA. And paper with dark and light regions, controlled by pencil and
eraser, could also control CdS resistance. The very high input resistance of
CMOS gates may let you charge up 1uF paper/mylar caps to serve as memory.

I've been wondering about this myself.  The house wiring thing is really
hokey.  There is no doubt that high pressure ultrasound is annoying, but to
whom?  Given that these devices have been advertised to be effective against
everything from insects to rodents to nasty dogs, what is to say that my
insect repeller won't just annnoy my dog and give me headaches?  Could there
be that much selectivity in frequencies?  Have there been ANY studies
on the effects of various pressure levels, bands, and sweep patterns on
various life forms?

And how effective could they be?  I certainly would not want to tell anyone
that they are safe from nasty dogs because they were carrying a piezoelectric
buzzer...

For me, it is a "I believe no gods exist" and a "I don't believe gods exist".
 
In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere
with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly
conclude that when "A exist" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the
Pragmatic definition of truth, "A exists" is meaningless makes A exist
even logically false.
 
A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god
by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even
make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include
some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting
all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.

I just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting,
where the consensus was that sumatriptan (Imitrex) has no advantages
over DHE-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side
effects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30).
Besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal
spray works?  DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has to
be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but most
neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.

: It's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third
: down, the other two thirds down) come from.
: 

The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube, these
2 wires will be found on all 17" trinitron tubes (e.g., Mitsubishi 17",
Sony 1604, etc).  On 14" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire.

Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the
sharpness of the T560i that I don't even notice the lines.

The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube,
has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in 
a flatter screen than other 17" monitors using the standard trinitron 
(which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and 
apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.

	HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF X -- monthly posting
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
	    Compiled by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)

  More RAM, Faster CPU's, More disk space, Faster Ethernet...  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation.

  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity.

  This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.

  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must
  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
  However, they are outside the scope of this document.

    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  IMHO, it contains a
    well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm
    unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]

Introduction & Administrivia
-----------------------------

  This document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the
  Usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers.
  If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few
  months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably
  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does
  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can
  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.

  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about
  them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the
  news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.

  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document
  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If
  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by
  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the
  command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body.

-----------------------------
What about the "Other X FAQ"?
-----------------------------

  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
  well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.
  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance.

  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with
  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:
	"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".
  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).

---------------
Window Managers
---------------

  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different
  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this
  point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager. 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,
  is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".
  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:
  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)
  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the
  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.

------------
The X Server
------------

Which Server?
- - - - - - -
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.

  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging.  
         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),
                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law
  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be
  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.
  You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial
  compilers on the market.

Locking the Server into RAM?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help
  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few
  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone
  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.

Starting your Server
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my
    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.

  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  

  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works, which I have summarized here:

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of
    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you
    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up.

    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources
    being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so
    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this
    initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there
  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap
  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients
  you are starting, etc.

  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

  I've experimented with:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &

  I've even tried:
	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &
  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down
    into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched. ]

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with
  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

Fonts
- - -
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one
  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or
  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server.
			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),
			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]

  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13
  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since
  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.

  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):
    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.
    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.

About the Resources File
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  One suggestion:

    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true

    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific
    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your
    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N

    [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
    --ed.]

    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from
    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,
    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system
    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to
    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name.

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).
		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),
		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),
		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits:

    - Easier to maintain / more usable.

    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

  It also has drawbacks:

    - the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference, and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the
      application without having to "xrdb" again.

    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!

      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped
      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted
      processing the resource file.

      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef
      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management.

    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For
      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.

    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client
      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my
  .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for
  clients that I seldom use.

Define Your Display Properly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In
  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]

  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name.

  "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially."
			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)

  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if
  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]

-------
Clients
-------

  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also
  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock?

  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]

  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject
  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In
  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually
  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.

  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try
  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif
  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library.

  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment.

A Better Clock for X
- - - - - - - - - - -

1) xcuckoo
   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.
   Saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar

   Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources.

  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and 
  takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.
  :-) 

A Better Terminal Emulator for X
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  From the README file distributed with xterm:

  +-----
  |		 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here
  |
  | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
  | ...
  +-----

  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.

  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),
		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]

1) Xvt
   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :
   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z

   "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get
   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog! "

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to
   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current
   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any
   yet.

   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For
   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling
   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap
   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard
   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.

   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it
   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets
   brought into memory.

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.
   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,
   relative speed of each

2) mterm
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in
     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.

   "I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is
   scrollback, but some people like it anyway."


Tuning your client
- - - - - - - - - -

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets:

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,
    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget
    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the
    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not
    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference
    on a [slower system].

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests?

-------------------------
Miscellaneous Suggestions
-------------------------

Pretty Pictures
- - - - - - - -
  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.

  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)

  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.

		      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) 
			for reminding me of this one. --ed.]

A Quicker Mouse
- - - - - - - -
  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.

  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for
  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  

  e.g. (for twm) :
      menu "mouse settings" {
        "Mouse Settings:"			f.title
	"  Very Fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &"
	"  Normal (Fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &"
	"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"	! "xset m default &"
	"  Glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &"
      }

Programming Thoughts
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of
    things you can do.  Some that stick out:

    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager
      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.

    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.

    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.
      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)

    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference.

    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one.

  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :
    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]

  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :

  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.

    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but
    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the
    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most
    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's event-loop again and again.

  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.

    This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

Say What!?

  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:

  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :
    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server.

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received
  the following confirmation...

  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was
    essential when I only had 8 MB.

  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :
    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a
    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's
    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they
    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your
    action.

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2
    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing
    even fewer context switches.

"The Max certainly has motor, but there are some things it is short of.
It is short of chassis.  It loves straight lines; aimed in one, it is
nicely stable.  But it is not overfond of corners.  Forced into one, it
protests, shaking its head, chattering its front tire, grinding its
footpegs, and generally making known its preference for straight
pavement.  Bumps?  It doesn't like them either.  Its fork isn't too bad,
though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking.
The shocks, though which work on that short-travel, shaft-drive
swingarm, are firm to the point of harshness."

The speed limit on commuter tracks in the northeast is 120MPH.  We

Interesting... after several hours worth of exposure, do you still posess

As per various threads on science and creationism, I've started dabbling into a
book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland.  A question
that I had come from one of his comments.  He stated that God is not 
necessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that
give explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific 
fact.  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I'm being vague. 
The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  Are there 
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?

This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into
the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There
was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of
state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.
The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was
mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that
many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with
low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for
travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a
university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well
as salary.

During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure
scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they 
were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is
probably because of the "research mind" approach, which is not to try
to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution
emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to
discussion about their problems, the job got done.

The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the
future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was
unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the
future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as 
NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly
keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,
making it more difficult for them to act to support research.

The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which
the government supports research the university will not provide funding,
and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,
as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of
a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask
for one?  The answer I will get is, "Get the money from NSF."  Now the
money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it
comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from
getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects
get supported, and how much.  

Also, the government decided that the "wealth" should be spread.  So instead
of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research
institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into
being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating
reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal
has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals
already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am
proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find 
impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow
I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea
which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to
something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, 
and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it
is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring 
more than minimal attention of a good researcher.  

I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would
have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government
is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.

I dont think you can mix the two types of drive, unless you have one of the
SCSI/IDE cards that is available.  You will have to turn your IDE off.

Instructions for drive type are included with the controller.  With some it may be
a type 1. no matter what the disk is.  With others it may be a type 47.  I had one
controller that I had to tell the BIOS that no hard disk was installed.

Do not low level format a SCSI unless you have the SCSI low level format program. 
First use fdisk to set the partitions, then use format.

No, they fold on the dotted line.  Look at pictures of carriers with loads of

  Good points.  In addition, I would point out that now is one of the
best times to fight this political battle, with much of the opposition
in disarray -- an FBI director (Sessions) on his way out, an Attorney
General (Reno) who has only been in long enough to find the office coffee
machine two tries out of three (and, between slow confirmations and
Clinton's Saturday Night Massacre, hasn't much of a staff in place).
If we really get lucky, both of the above will be too busy trying to
keep their feet from being held to the Waco fire to spend much effort
insisting on their alleged right to spy on the American people.

Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably

Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,
where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure
of better. The concept is called "context", and you should really become
familiar with it someday.

>The facts are that Morris
>has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a WS winning club.
>Clemens hasn't.

Unless this transaltes to "Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to
the Jays," I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.

>You can go on about what Clemens has done in the 
>past and claim that he is "better" than Morris if you want to.  But 
>the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens

What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has "won" 68% of
the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17
wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If
so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in
his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But
I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it
would have been a routine groundout, right?

Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.

No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the
World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they
keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they
traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link
between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs
out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,
gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.

Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,
and why? Did Morris somehow "learn how to win" in the intervening ten years?
If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half
a run lower than 1992?

Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some
help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray
level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4
bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they
did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but
they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they
would call Japan, etc.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images
from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not
like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on
getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

That's closer, but I dislike "apps".  "software" (vs. "hardware")

Come on!  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war

All of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-
Israel activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if
anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.

No, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from
the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa (

INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL

The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on
cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of
millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as
export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to
robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.

However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already
reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any
public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the
Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the
National Security Agency.  The so-called "Clipper Chip" is an 80-bit,
split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips
manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would
store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon
presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be
classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for
incorporation into its communications products.

     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .

First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an
inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure
product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.
Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for
the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers
should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.

Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the
Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF
believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The
public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is
open to independent, expert scrutiny.  

Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may
prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement
needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is
adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? 
Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth
Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few
of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to
answer.

In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance
of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy
and security.  However, the "Clipper Chip" solution ought to be
considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the
discussion even begins.

DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:

ESCROW

The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom
hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device
would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow
agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.

Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would
have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to
the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be
asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration
have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the
Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,
but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.

CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS

The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which
the government or others could break the code without securing keys from
the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no
back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,
Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto
cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the
algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be
made public.

The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,
secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private
firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for
about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.

GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER

In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes
in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers
for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al
Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press
briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any
private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had
no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?

COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY

The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an
inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,
and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export
controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony
Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the
National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential
Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement
in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.

That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.
Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser
gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers
who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on
self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the
data on computer disk.

The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will
notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called
a "bingo card" in the industry) includes lines for a company name
and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national
advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as
best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company
and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably
send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer
call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they
will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail
outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th
e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have
nothing to mail out accept the catalog.

A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry
magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They
use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read
the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push
you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile
how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.
This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that "23% of readers
requesting data were interested in capacitors." And finally, some
magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For
example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information
about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.

The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines
include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the
advertiser can attempt to cull out the "literature collectors" from
the serious potential customers.

"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could."

What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?

  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more
  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of
  weeks later.

  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want
  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also
  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually
  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data
  on a computer printout.

  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're
  not really "qualified" for, send in a bingo card at least every
  other month and circle two or three numbers.

  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.
  Advertisers almost never call.

Yes, everyone who is normal does that.  We use candida on the other arm
when we put a tuberculin test on.  If people don't react to candida,
we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not
react to anything.  All normal people have antibodies to candida.
If not, you would quickly turn into a fungus ball.

You've just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory.
Find something that no one can *disprove* and then write a book saying
it is the cause of whatever.  Since no one can disprove it, you can

That is odd, isn't it?  Why do you suppose it is that MDs with these

1.  The Magellan mission at Venus continues normally, gathering gravity
data which provides measurement of density variations in the upper
mantle which can be correlated to surface topography.  Spacecraft
performance is nominal.

2.  Magellan has completed 7225 orbits of Venus and is now 39 days from
the end of Cycle-4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.

3.  No significant activities are expected next week, as preparations
for aerobraking continue on schedule.

4.  On Monday morning, April 19, the moon will occult Venus and
interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about 68 minutes.

        No, because "we" have decided that it doesn't make enough
difference to "us" to get up and do something.  That's something,
for instance, a lot of people who go speak against gun control
bills at their local government.  Dozens of "pro-gun" speakers
show up and few if any antis do, but  they often win anyway.
 
        Why?  Because it doesn't matter who shows up, it matters
who's willing to scream afterwards.  And it isn't that most people
give a damn one way of the other, but that they don't.  Nobody
gives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds.

Yes,

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north
side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.  Lodging is
probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  Good luck.

It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle
busses running between the arena and the mall.

If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA
office.  It should be free if you are an AAA member.

If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly
good time to start to think about going to the hamvention.

I know you said E-mail preferred but because this is a common problem
with WPWin I'll post it here.

The screen only LOOKS like the text is gone. Usually you can just
page-up then page-down and when it does a complete refresh the
text reappears. I have had--on "rare" occasions--to completely 
exit (save first) the program. When I reopened the file, all chaos
had been resolved. I don't know WHY it does this, but it is annoying.

Far from being "tossed out," the gospels are taken, almost
universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.
I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who "tosses out"
the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,
but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb
ascribes this more broadly.

Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is
why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far
outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels
*not* taken as "gospel truth" that faithfully records just what
happened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and
the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken
this way by a critical reader.

There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,
measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the
text as "historically valid" or "tosses out" the text.  I suspect
this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and
secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,
and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present
historical arguments along these lines for their religious
program.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary
school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better
such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed
above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if
it bit him on the keister twice.

Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts
and their use in studying history.  First, all texts are
historically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I
have never seen a notion of "historical validity" that makes any
sense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as
telling the "gospel truth" about historical events, in the way
that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and
secondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite
author's history of whatever.)

Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some
person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every
text can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can
we learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does
the text provide evidence?

The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of
Oregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical
evidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the 
vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The
modern American history textbooks that whitewash "great American
figures" are historical evidence.  These are all historical
evidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all
that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that
Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that "great
American figures" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.
They are better evidence that some people "saw" the Maharishi,
late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians
thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe
"saw" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an
educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather
than teach history.

How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of
historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a
very complex question that has no easily summarized answer.
There are many books on the subject or various parts of the
subject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's "Historian's Fallacies"
as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy
to read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy
to read.  Give it a try.

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated 
in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion
and national origin?

1) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of Van.[1,2,3,4,5]
2) Armenians did slaughter 42% of Muslim population of Bitlis.[1,2,3,4]
3) Armenians did slaughter 31% of Muslim population of Erzurum.[1,2,3,4]
4) Armenians did slaughter 26% of Muslim population of Diyarbakir.[1,2,3,4]
5) Armenians did slaughter 16% of Muslim population of Mamuretulaziz.[1,2,3,4]
6) Armenians did slaughter 15% of Muslim population of Sivas.[1,2,3,4]
7) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of the x-Soviet
   Armenia.[1,2,3,4]

I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to
be carcinogenic that "it would not be legal in the U.S.".  I think that
naturally occuring substances (excluding "controlled" substances) are
pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives
or other "consumption".  It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an
ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they 
really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything.
How in the world do you suppose it's legal to "consume" tobacco products
(which probably SHOULD be banned)?

I suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical
"assault weapon".  You are wrong.  Compared to what most criminals use, a
9mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremely
rare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (FMJs), the .32 H&R magnum with
"civie" bullets is more lethal.  Most of the arms which criminals (and
the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.

What if we just punish the criminal and leave the law abiding citizen
alone?  It hasn't been tried in recient times, but it might work.

You should have tried one of the soc.culture groups in the Middle East
or South Asia area (they are a little more open than the Islam channel).  
I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the 
world created itself (or something like that) so each particle is a God 
which created the other Gods.  The soc.culture.african is also nice for 
some contrasting viewpoints on the benevolence of religion.  Especially 
when Sudan is mentioned.

If you are going to translate, you have to do it consistently. If you 
selectively translate things to serve your ugly purpose, people get 
pisssssssssed offfffff. 

In Ottoman times messengers were usually killed by cutting their heads off and
sending it back to their country. But Ottoman empire no longer exists :(.

  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago
about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)
As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult
to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:
  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out 
    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
    breathing effort (let alone anything else)

  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is
    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled
    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)
    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen
    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough
    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.

  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough
    gas per unit volume. 

  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
or interfere with their healing or anything like that...

I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view.  I don't like to see stickwork,
but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move
(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back
of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of
bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm 
talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the 
player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid
retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of 
position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short
side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with
helpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who
I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays
huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)

   PARIS, Dec 22, -- Marseilles is excited by a weird story of the arrival in
that port of a ship flying the British flag and named Zan carrying a
mysterious cargo of 400 tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there.
The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and
to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the
rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.

On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians,
we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an 
emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.

In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed 
de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a 
genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The 
result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen
and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization
on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish
governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In 
the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies 
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy 
merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state 
policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a 
crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the 
successful genocide of the Armenians.

Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...
Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of 
Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as 
"rebels".

Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population
figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.

Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims 
Armenians were a "threat".

In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of 
approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.

Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The
success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish
population.

The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and
property lost as a result of this genocide.

   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

I'd say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something
much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.
That particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of
thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.

Once you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do
something longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road
like Mines-Mt. Hamilton.

In any case, it's *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she
has proper gear that fits - especially if you're going sport

There's plenty of legroom on the Kawasaki KLR650.  A bit

NNTP-Posting-Host: amethyst.ces.cwru.edu

Hi !

I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board
from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems
utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.

I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use
to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.

The problem is that my top level frame created as
	frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL);
seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.
I tried using the following Xlib code :

XVisualInfo visual_info;
int depth = 24;
Colormap colormap;
XSetWindowAttributes attribs;
unsigned long valuemask = 0;
Window *win;
Xv_opaque frame;

win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID);
XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);

/* So far so good */

colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);

/* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */

attribs.colormap = colormap;
valuemask |= CWColormap;
XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs);
XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);


Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?

Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

Thanks again,


Alok.

  Yes, I do.  

  My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to
  kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)
  purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has
  almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing
  innocents, is unconscionable.

  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our
  transportation system are based on their merits to society, not
  their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent
  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued
  existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and
  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.

  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital
  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with
  no net positive gain.  Why?

  Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond
  that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life
  at all.  But I won't open that debate, as it seems others are
  tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.

AAAHHHH!!!!!  Please someone tell me what I have done!!!

My 40 Meg miniscribe (8450AT) has a big sticker on the side that says

***DO NOT ROTATE INTERRUPTER** --->  (big knob here)

A big knob sticking off the side of the drive is pretty hard NOT to turn
when removing the drive!

I turned it.   Now the drive won't spin up!  Even with no data or controller
cables plugged in.. just power... it won't spin up!!

Please help!  

Thanks

I checked the FAQ on this first, and no luck..


I need to convert the R5 Tree widget for use with xview v3.0. The

I just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too.  I don't
know why.  Perhaps because they weren't as profitable as cafergot.
Too bad, since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients
and they don't do any good flushed down the toilet.  I suspect
we'll be moving those patients more and more to the DHE nasal
spray, which is far more effective.

Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political
office, in Northlands, and in the business community that the Oilers
with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly
basis they will likely have an operating loss based on "normal" hockey
revenues and expenses.  That he did this was a good thing...it is better
he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would
truly jeopardize the franchise.

Pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell
a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in Northlands, or
via a new building.  Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly
what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough.

There are a lot of risks in moving a team also...

...one has to remember "Peter Puck's principle"...it is better to
spend other people's money than one's own if at all possible.

i say extended warranties are a ripoff, high-profit item for dealers.
but what i really want to point out here is that you are not buying
5/60k, 6/75k, 6/100k.  you get 3yr/36k *free*.  so what you are buying is
2/24k, 3/39k, 3/64k.  keep that in mind when you look at the cost vs. coverage.
another point is that many car companies routinely fix car problems that are
out of warranty...why?  design/manufacturing defects that the company owns up
to, keeping customer happy, etc.

10:06 A.M. EDT
             
             
             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to
you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio
station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to
meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,
health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly
broadcast with the American people. 
             
             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when
it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past
seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with
the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus
tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last
year's campaign.
             
             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with
you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and
what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting
to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.
             
             You sent me to Washington to get our government and
economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad
experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important
it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do
business.  
             
             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations
rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness
of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the
cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,
labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the
industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've
made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which
our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them
have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been
falling behind.
             
             We have an economy today that even when it grows is
not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation
by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to
show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have
stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks
and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating
cost of health care.
             
             But we also know that, given the right tools, the
right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and
businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy
needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better
places to live.
             
             In many critical products today Americans are the
low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that
we create more of those kinds of jobs.
             
             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for
long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old
priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to
be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs
and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the
waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious
resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the
groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.
             
             These new directions passed the Congress in record
time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our
country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would
create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private
sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It
now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. 
But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the
Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know
would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.
             
             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. 
Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and
counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill
has been grounded by gridlock.  
             
             I know the American people are tired of business as
usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin
or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have
taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra
mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25
percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  
             
             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million
Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill
languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean
hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to
act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking
this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I
think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant
portion of our original goals.
             
             First, we want to keep the programs as much as
possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,
including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young
people, immunization for children, construction of waste water
sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding
for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who
have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't
creating jobs.
             
             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs
in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40
percent.
             
             And third, I've recommended a new element in this
program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against
crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire
police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put
them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight
for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it
and deserve it.
             
             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --
the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it
increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this
year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,
doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more
than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this
budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the
Congress this year.
             
             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators
who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous
administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of
emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the
American people to work.  
             
             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered
a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities
are -- on people or on politics.  
             
             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar
for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the
soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our
children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs
and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of
us when we've helped make more American partners working to
ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.
             
             You know, if every American who wanted a job had
one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this
country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first
step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country
again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid
for over the life of our budget.
             
             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how
important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.
             
             Good morning, and thank you for listening.

                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT

Not that new.  20 years ago, we had drug addicts harboring active TB
that was resistant to everything (in Chicago).  The difference now
is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such
TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just
infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance
with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains
has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9
drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to
such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we
are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary
even if they entail force.

Hei Pei.

I can not help you directly width you problem, but there may be
intermediate roads to take to get to the IFF. I am using a converter
that can take IGES, IIF, DXF -> IGES, MILESPEC I IGES, MILESPEC II IGES, 
IIF, MILESPEC I IIF, MILESPEC II IIF  and DXF.

IIF is IBM IGES FORMAT. There may be converters out there that can handle
IGES to IFF. Hope this was to any help. By the way the converter is part
of the IGES Processor/6000 package from IBM and it runs on RS/6000 AIX.

       Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are
verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments
abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid
to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused

       I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell
pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.  

       It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust
the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed
to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies
total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.

       This is very likely.

       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many
people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're
here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is
necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should
have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.
Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more
magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more
heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.

>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:
>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!

       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,
two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide
rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about
half the per-car death rate.

      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The
fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,
whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally
irrelevent.

      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous
impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.

      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt
to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even
if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.

>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them
>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,
>it's the 'axer' ??
>(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)


       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.
(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per 
se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's
countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got
more knives or fists.  

       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.
have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms
of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they
are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is 
violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The
*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of
99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that
you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.

>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect
>themselves. Is this a good situation ?? 

       The situation is not "good" in that people fear for their lives.
But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,
protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,
too, lost their livelihoods?

>Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??

       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.
However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can
be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition
won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.

       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If
you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is
a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully
simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,
as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)

>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have
>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)

       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.
That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.
Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the
group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.

       You may take that for what it's worth.

Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all
the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.

I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean
it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles
who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine
messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has
that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that
such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry of
Revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try
and make it apply to events 20 centuries later.

Okay, now here's my interpretation of _Boomer_, based on the facts as
presented in the New York Court of Appeals<*> holding (_Boomer v.

<*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York
   State.  While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their
   highest court "Supreme Court," "Supreme Judicial Court" or "Supreme
   Court of Appeals," Maryland and New York call theirs simply the
   "Court of Appeals."  To make matters worse, New York also calls its
   _second-highest_ court the "Supreme Court, Appellate Division"...

Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):

Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's
plant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to
which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he
defendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course
of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the
plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the
plant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked
the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.

(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned
their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.
Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)

Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court
ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided
that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In
other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the
power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment
of their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is
always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a
private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.

(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if
it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks
like eminent domain...)

Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that
"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the
plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million
dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages."  Blackmail?

    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....
    "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to
    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose
    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under
    extortion statutes.")

How do you define as "blackmail" one party's act of demanding the right
to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns
and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of
demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see
it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of
owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to
stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price
they wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says
that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.

You go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- the
plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,
because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to
having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less
than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation."

If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from
other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those
other parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice
between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,
shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_
business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_
the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was
Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type
of plant they did where and when they did.)

And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; the
plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."
As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole."
They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners
of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price
acceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made
whole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided?
(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were
supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)

(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at my
school.

(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for
their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first
encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal
opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get
into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick
and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional
Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly
and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously
intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly
biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors
tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is
especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are
practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_
educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat
cloistered scholar.  End of aside.)

I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons
I've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can
only call "economic correctness" over justice.

(2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged
right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid
losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and
the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to
not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who
own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.
(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other
branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take
other people's property by eminent domain.)

I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to
as "law and economics" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical
analysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use to
help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by
the scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by
_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics
of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.

The test isn't whether GM knew--otherwise that would reward GM for its
stupidity.  The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their
existence.  It works both ways--if GM had won the trial, and the plaintiff
turned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should
have been located beforehand, too bad, so sad--no new trial.

Like Tim said, you don't get a new civil trial because you screwed up 
the first time around.  Unlike the criminal justice system, repose is
much more important in the civil justice system.

Hi,

	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So, 
I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!

	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,
Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:

	Ai [Current Gain]
	Av [Voltage Gain]
	Ap [Power Gain]
	or whatever.

I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but
I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts
list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin? 
SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag
so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could
figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas? 

	I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp 
models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High
power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than
I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me? 

I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help!
Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News... 
And I'll post if there's and interest!

Nntp-Posting-Host: sunspot.ece.clarkson.edu

It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a
police agency.  It just might be a bad idea for them, too.

OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They
need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they
now need to 

   (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of
       the key.

Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses?
Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State
and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,
while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,
statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately
clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying
new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen
ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting
without a dialing license?]

There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, 
how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough
safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and 
it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, 
how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type
chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal
Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of
the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of 
these kinds of problems will be open for public or "expert" scrutiny?]  

Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, 
even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be 
an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a 
key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political 
embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:
 
   (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and
       turns the results over to the NY State Police.

But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton
Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war
going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.
Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an
extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another
bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.

I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. In
scenario (b), who pays the bill?

If you are referring to the terms "effeminate" and "homosexuals" in
the above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has
been challenged.  However, I was simply commenting on the charge that
it is an "incredibly perverse" interpretation to read this as a
condemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no
reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul
intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a
reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse.
Therefore I do not believe it is "incredibly perverse" to read it in
this way.

Actually, I wasn't thinking of the church at all.  After all, a couple
doesn't have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the
peace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point
was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual
marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage
between two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical
basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to
"save themselves" for such a marriage and to never have sexual
intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please
note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be
willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing
opinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past
that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main
points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to
be Christian would advocate such a position.  So what is the gay view?

No cookies, Charlie. The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited
as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence. In this case, it
is for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been
seen. Further, there are zillions of other spook stories, and one would
hardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of
a resurrection.
 
There have been more elaborate arguments made, but it looks as if they have
not passed your post filtering.

It is no evidence in the strict meaning. If there was actual evidence it would
probably be part of it, but the says nothing about the claims.

The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common

- Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will use the Motif

- Do they mean both of the above?

- Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with
  an OpenLook Look & Feel?

- How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F?
  (I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?)

- Will there be more than one "standard" toolkit API or L & F supported?

- How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif?

Summary: Ron Miller book on history of spaceships from Krieger Publishing

Ron Miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career.  
I've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar System
Exploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of
spaceflight.  For several years he's been working on a *big* project
which is almost ready to hit the streets.  A brochure from his
publisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enough
to type in part of it (it's rather long).  Especially given the Net's
strong interest in vaporware spacecraft...

                 ==================================

                         The Dream Machines:
An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature

                            By Ron Miller
                  with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke

Krieger Publishing Company
Melbourne, Florida, USA
Orig. Ed. 1993
Pre-publication $84.50
ISBN 0-89464-039-9


This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a
technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the
space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the
tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make
such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized
that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to
reach them.   

Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,
attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of
technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel
became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed
than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that
matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason
as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate
reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and
knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as
well as selected events important in developing the idea of
extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological
entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and
speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between
simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal
connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every
entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every
spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This
allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize
differences, similarities, and influences.

This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,
and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic
diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and
historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The
unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and
very interesting history of the spaceship.

SPECIAL FEATURES

Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and
fictional

Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos
contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare
illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and
drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and
obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA
archives

An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

He'll slam Clinton for anything at all on the air.  I just do not
understand why he remains so popular.  He'll take a piece of video of
Clinton walking along; find a frame in which Clinton wrinkles his
nose, say; freeze on it and blow it up full screen; and then rant for

(it was around the time of the inauguration).  Can anyone call this

anyone with half a brain in his or her head[1] continue to watch
it[2]?

I have a mac plus with 2.5MB RAM. I have just bought an extra 2MB so that
I can have the max 4MB RAM that a plus supports. However, I can't get it
to boot after I install the 2 extra SIMMs. Instead I get a sad mac (Sorry,
but I can't remember the code). Looking at the motherboard, I can see
that 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says "256Kb path -
1 row". I assume that was done when the first 1MB SIMMs were added.

So, my question is: Are there any other resistors that need snipping? 
				or, Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged?

Any and all advice will be appreciated.

The Adaptec 1540-series use bus mastering.  This means that the CPU
doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other
computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is.  DOS
just sits and waits anyway.

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE
was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is*
ISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA -
8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.

This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast
slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA
speed.  Heck, that's what ISA slots do - I'll just use one of those
instead.

In a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me to
pull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.''  The 51 day
standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19
in what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million
dollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and
assigning blame.

\

From the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President
Clinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney
general or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was
{\it entirely theirs}.  {\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter
Attorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,
Reno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved
the plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the
details.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''
As the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said
that he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that
``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the
course of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that
[Reno's] decision.''

\

How did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile
assault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much
more than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The
assault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF
to show their might and just purpose.

\

At the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents
made their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state
that they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.
Silently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started
their ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades
and ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.

\

If unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues
were to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not
assume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The
tactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.

\

The initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives
were lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal
media would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents
carting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any
violation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media
would proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the
BATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the
Branch Davidians.

\

As far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like
Philadelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,
and a city block razed.
It appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock
raids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that
the no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking
for, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.
The BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or
flushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to
``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\it This policy of no-knock
raids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use
of military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,
and is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that
their fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches
and seizures''] are not denied.

This may be a simple question but:

We have a number of PC's which we use to link to a mainframe using 
Novell LAN WorkPlace for DOS (via WIndows 3.1). 
Now, to make life easier for us we are thinking of using Windows for
Workgroups to allow file sharing across our PC network. 

Now does anyone know if it is possible to use W4WG and Lan Workplace
for DOS at the same time. 

ie Can I access a file on another PC while being logged on to the
mainframe at the same time, simultaneously.

Any help well appreciated.

I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a
chance to read the news for a couple of days...

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private
Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the user's eye.

The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA
compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up
and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background.

I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly
used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.

I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in
the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.

This is easily done by getting a large toroid core from your local
electronics shop, a toroid core is a ceramic/metal "donut", and wind the
telephone line in through the center of the core and out around the

Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not
a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the
man born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the
simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner
of one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them,
do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.

And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation
does not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist,
who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to 
have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But 
it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether 
he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in 
the first case and very weak in the third.

I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the
different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated
earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our
time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of
Christianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do
accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they
are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure.
I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring
to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity
takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth
lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed 
in this newsgroup in particular.

I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives
largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an
authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light
of these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-
nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later
times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first
two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes 
important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our 
understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the 
significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I 
have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible 
to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.

I think I've seen this bike.  Is it all white, with a sea-green stripe
and just 'HONDA' for decals, I've seen such a bike numerous times over
by Sewall hall at CU, and I thought it was a race-prepped CBR. 
I didn't see it over at the EC parking lot (I buzzed over there on my 
way home, all of 1/2 block off my route!)  but it was gone.

Is a single sided swingarm available for the CBR?  I would imagine so, 
kinda neccisary for quick tire changes.  When I first saw it, I assumed it
was a bike repainted to cover crash damage.

    I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the
literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are
two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have
an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.

    Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with
an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this
configuration then you are getting an FPU.

>>Why say "optional" if it's built in?

    Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.

>If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with

    This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed
to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the
buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.

>Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU
>system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system

    This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs
of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full
040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching
chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.

    They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated
countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware
designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that
the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.

Hello,

I want a little network for 3 users. All users want to run Windows.
The most important things I want for the network are: file-sharing,
mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem
card on one of the computers. We all want to use each others harddisk.

My idea was to buy three computers (one 486DX and two 386DX). All
three have a 40Mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large
harddisk. All three also have a network card. The 486 is connected to
the printers and contains the fax/modem card. And last but not least:
Workgroups for Windows.

My questions:
- Is this possible?
- What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups
  for Windows?
- Will all the computers be fast enough? Behind all three, someone
  is working.

Thanks,
Martijn

[REMAINDER DELETED]

I don't have my copy of the manual with me right now, but I can offer the
following in the interim:

   1)  The card uses port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8 (which are NOT
       configurable).  These addresses, incidentally, were inadvertantly
       omitted from my version of the manual.

   2)  I believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
       IRQ 2 (for CGA or EGA support??!?).

    EQUATIONS

	Where d is distance, v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time.
	Additional more specialized equations are available from:

	    ames.arc.nasa.gov:pub/SPACE/FAQ/MoreEquations


	For constant acceleration
	    d = d0 + vt + .5at^2
	    v = v0 + at
	  v^2 = 2ad

	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
	    rotation period t:

	    a = 4 pi**2 r / t^2

	For circular Keplerian orbits where:
	    Vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc = escape velocity
	    M	 = Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	 = Gravitational constant (defined below)
	    u	 = G * M (can be measured much more accurately than G or M)
	    K	 = -G * M / 2 / a
	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
	    V	 = orbital velocity
	    P	 = orbital period
	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit

	    Vc	 = sqrt(M * G / r)
	    Vesc = sqrt(2 * M * G / r) = sqrt(2) * Vc
	    V^2  = u/a
	    P	 = 2 pi/(Sqrt(u/a^3))
	    K	 = 1/2 V**2 - G * M / r (conservation of energy)

	    The period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.

	Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit:

	    delta V = 2 sqrt(GM/r) sin (phi/2)

	Energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit).

	    GMm (1/Re - 1/2Rcirc)
	    Re = radius of the earth
	    Rcirc = radius of the circular orbit.

	Classical rocket equation, where
	    dv	= change in velocity
	    Isp = specific impulse of engine
	    Ve	= exhaust velocity
	    x	= reaction mass
	    m1	= rocket mass excluding reaction mass
	    g	= 9.80665 m / s^2

	    Ve	= Isp * g
	    dv	= Ve * ln((m1 + x) / m1)
		= Ve * ln((final mass) / (initial mass))

	Relativistic rocket equation (constant acceleration)

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)

	Relativistic rocket with exhaust velocity Ve and mass ratio MR:

	    at/c = Ve/c * ln(MR), or

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(Ve/c * ln(MR))
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(Ve/C * ln(MR)) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(Ve/C * ln(MR))

	Converting from parallax to distance:

	    d (in parsecs) = 1 / p (in arc seconds)
	    d (in astronomical units) = 206265 / p

	Miscellaneous
	    f=ma    -- Force is mass times acceleration
	    w=fd    -- Work (energy) is force times distance

	Atmospheric density varies as exp(-mgz/kT) where z is altitude, m is
	molecular weight in kg of air, g is local acceleration of gravity, T
	is temperature, k is Bolztmann's constant. On Earth up to 100 km,

	    d = d0*exp(-z*1.42e-4)

	where d is density, d0 is density at 0km, is approximately true, so

	    d@12km (40000 ft) = d0*.18
	    d@9 km (30000 ft) = d0*.27
	    d@6 km (20000 ft) = d0*.43
	    d@3 km (10000 ft) = d0*.65

(How is 0-40 twice 1.25? Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes
the statment "correct"?)
Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are
completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).

Great, you can compare two numbers (ATA has several speed modes, by the
way) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.

I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs
if they are really interested in this stuff.

Something is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of
opportunity for marketing jingo like "SCSI-2 compliant" which tells
you nothing about the performance, whether it has "WIDE" support, etc.

I know of at least one ftp-site from which you can download the cracks of
about any commercial game in existence. The names of the companies (yes,
companies!) are also blatantly advertised with the crack codes. According to
them, it is not illegal (at least in the USA, according to a statute or 
something) to remove the copy protection from any program. The only condition
is that you may only use this code on legally owned software for your own
convenience.

If there is any interest I will download the advertisement of one such 
company. I will not give the name of this ftp-site to anyone, even if only
to protect the companies which wrote the original games.

DISCLAIMER: I do not condone the use or cracking of any programs. I believe 
it hurts the industry and individuals in the long run.

On the subject of copy protection: Most pirates don't give a damn about 
using software on which the name of the registered owner came up on starting 
the program. They just don't have a conscience.

Reasonably fancy.

Standard "voice" circuits run at 56kbps inter-exchange in the US.
Therefore, you need to achieve 4:1 to get standard voice quality.

If you're willing to give up some quality, you need only 2:1.  This is still
acceptable from a speech standpoint; it will be a little less faithful to
the original, but certainly intelligable.  That's all you really need for
this application.

Subject: Creating Your own ColorMap, i.e. Lookup Table in X11 R4
Lines: 99

Hello,

Below I have the copy of some source I am using to setup a user-specified color-
map for X R11 V4. I am attempting to create user defined colors in terms of
RGB color ranges. The calls to XAllocColor prove ineffective. 

Variables are defined are as follows:

    int                 i, j, k, lut_index
    color_type          min_image, max_image;
    color_type          image Pixel_Value_Range, last_image, start, end, jump,
                        lut [ 512 ];
    unsigned long       pixel;
    double              red, green, blue;

/*
 * Data structure used by color operations

typedef struct {
        unsigned long pixel;
        unsigned short red, green, blue;

        char pad;
} XColor;
***************/
    XColor              rgbcolor, hardwarecolor;


With color_type defined as { double red, double green, double blue }.

What I need to know is how to set [is it possible] the values in hardwarecolor
to work within the call to XAllocColor:

    start.red = (int) 255 * min_image.red;	/* 0..255 */
    end.red   = (int) 255 * max_image.red;	/* 0..255 */

    end.green   = (int) 255 * max_image.green;  /* 0..255 */
    jump.green  = (int) (( end.green - start.green ) / 7);

    start.blue = (int) 255 * min_image.blue;    /* 0..255 */
    end.blue   = (int) 255 * max_image.blue;    /* 0..255 */

Assuming you are refering to standard POTS or ground start lines:

If you are looking at loop start lines under idle conditions, the RING
conductor is the one with approximately -48 to -52 vDC with respect to
ground while the TIP conductor is at or very near ground potential (be sure
to reference the telco ground when taking your measurements).  

If you are dealing with ground start lines under idle conditions, the RING
conductor will be the one with approximately -48 to -52 vDC while the TIP
conductor would look like it's floating (you may see some potential from
line capacitance it will bleed off over time).  Remember to use the telco
ground as your reference when making measurements.

   Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I
is running at that speed.  I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running
at something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long

   Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for

    I have some advice for you, and some thoughts about

1. A real team like Toronto would not be moved, you are right,
   just eliminated from the playoffs first round!
2. Why stay in Minnesota when you can go to a college in
   Western Ontario and actually take classes on map-reading
   and the Artistry of BSing specifically set up for just you.
3. Why should anyone love the Stars, when hating the Leafs
   is so much better?
4. Oh, I'm sorry.. well, maybe you can't understand my

  Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This
doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in
the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.

  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like
it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,
and isn't.  
  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has
forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement.
  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of
oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to
live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great
deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the 
male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.
  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great
ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings
and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long
tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  
Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism
is an attractive option.
  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)
should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.

Subject: polygon orientation in DXF?

Hi.  I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database
format used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores
the points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a 
little and it seems that the points are stored in the order
they are drawn.

Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the 
points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert,
but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know 
which direction the polygon should be visible from.

If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?
The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one
in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that
doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...

Thanks in advance for any help,

He's been playing horrible defense. Baylor said after Wednesday's game that
he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been
having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting.
He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young
was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.

In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium
is a bitch to play. Some of the visiting outfielders have been having
some problems too (although Bobby Bonilla made a great catch crashing into
the wall to rob Daryl Boston of an extra base hit in Thursday's game)

But it's STILL HAPPENING.  That's the entire point.  Only last month, John
Major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of
arms to Saudi Arabia.  The same month, we sold jet fighters to the same
Indonesian government that's busy killing the East Timorese.

It's all very well to say "Oops, we made a boo-boo, better clean up the
mistake", but the US and UK *keep* making the *same* mistake.  They do it so
often that I can't believe it's not deliberate.  This suspicion is reinforced
by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit
economy reliant on arms sales.

Two things to watch for:
In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some
of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
phone can be set to pulse dialing.
In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
are pushed "down" by one position; this makes dialing (and
in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.
OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course
illegal.

One thing that seems ambiguous is whether a signal being echoed down from
geosynchronous orbit is "...from outside the United States."

Also, being able to assess whether NSA is playing by the rules requires
knowing what the rules are. We only know a subset. For those even more
suspicious, there could be other surveillance organizations "blacker"
than the NSA.

you'd be surprised how much the little knick-knack stuff can cost?  what if

The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Most
of the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively
DX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are
better off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows the
DX2-66 to be generally faster anyway.

                        ( ANOTHER Form of COLD FUSION )

               ( ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe ) 

               A very simple experiment can demonstrate (PROVE) the 
          FACT of "BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS" (reactions like Mg + O 
          --> Ca, Si + C --> Ca, K + H --> Ca, N2 --> CO, etc.), as 
          described in the BOOK "Biological Transmutations" by Louis 
          Kervran, [1972 Edition is BEST.], and in Chapter 17 of the 
          book "THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS" by Peter Tompkins and 
          Christopher Bird, 1973: 

               (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same 
                   kind.  [Some kinds might work better that others.]

               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight 
                   and number.

               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper 
                   for three or four weeks.

               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.

               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of 
                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least 
                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]

               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for 
                   mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the 
                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier 
                   mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen, 
                   hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]

          
               BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our 
          own bodies. 
          
               Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with 
          carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can SPEED 
          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much 
          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).  
          
               Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-
          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, 
          oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. 
          
               The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms, 
          cause "STONE SICKNESS" in statues, building bricks, etc..  
          
               The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron, 
          creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators 
          and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones). 
          
               Some bacteria can even NEUTRALIZE RADIOACTIVITY! 
          

               ALL OF THESE THINGS AND MORE HAPPEN, IN SPITE OF the 
          currently accepted "laws" of physics, (including the law

Let me see if I got this right.

Group of religious plinter schismatics erect a compound
and after at least fifty years of peaceful co-existance
with the outside community (having shoot outs only with
each other) - this makes them dangerous.  Prior history
would seem to indicate they are only dangerous to themselves.

Last I knew there was no National Branch Davidian Party
blaming the debacle in VeitNam on Foreign Meddlers and
three-two beer, calling for the Rounding up of Meat Packers,
Growers and Slaughter Houses.

You want tough political choices - how about letting odd balls
be odd balls?  (I know, this requires tolerance for 
those that go into Government - but we all know people
who have no useful skills.)


ith the death of the children everybody is getting
real upset - what about the other 40 plus people?
I suppose that you consider children to be property
of the state with the family as custodians. (In the
States its the other way around - children are parental property.)
If what you consider a Corrupt Government demands that
you send you children into _their_ tender care - I
suppose that you will obey the State and turn you children
over to their care.  Sorry - I am not as enamoured of the
womb to tomb cradle that is IngSoc.

Gotta go, the beach is calling.

This problem is usually a low +5 Vdc from the power supply, there is an  
adjustment for this on the supply. If the voltage is still unstable or low  
then the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR20.

I don't sign any blank checks.

nukes.  When Sarah Brady says "weapons of mass destruction" she means
Street Sweeper shotguns and semi-automatic SKS rifles.  When John
Lawrence Rutledge says "weapons of mass destruction," and then immediately

     I'm posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail
access.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more
relevant than I, who have none (yet).

>1.  Ages & sexes of children
     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl

>2.  Do you spank your kids?
     I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.

>3.  If so how often?
     I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something
very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running
into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has
not been spanked yet.
     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course
I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.

>4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?
     No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall
why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time
to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the
impact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the
fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -
is called a spanking.
>
>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?
     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared
a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made
sure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him
lose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.
     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep
arguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine.
I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they
calm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're
really young.

>6.  Your age?
     40

>7.  Your location
     Bath, Ohio.  It's right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.

>8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal
>offence?
     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to
teach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use
that as an excuse to hit too hard.

>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid
     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never
used spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they
were almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,
none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.
     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that "what
ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me."  The Bible also says in all
things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)
There is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with
at times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved
a little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the
devil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid
to his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's
forgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that
what I had done was enough punishment.

Now my comments: 

I'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - 
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife.  

The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. 

Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live 
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport 
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels 
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, 
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - 
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch 
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, 
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  

To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that 
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.

I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (Then again
I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears
for the second time:

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

Thanks for any hints

I didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't enough.  Gund's offer
was the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November
lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the
playoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn't help Sather with his
immediate objectives, doesn't help with long term objectives (only a
prospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that).
However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to
Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund
panicks sooner in November. And here's another what-if twist: Chicago
would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the
first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in
Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan
all look like geniuses.

A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston
(and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you
shiver doesn't it. :-)

Bottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for
Kisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one.

Are you serious?
	- Let Ferierra go,
	- fire Kingston (these last two basically mean that
		Sharks are starting over again in terms of the
		timetable to capture the Cup. As I've stated
		frequently: 5 out 6 expansion teams had the same GM
		from inception through Cup season)

	- broadcast more home games than away games
	- broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games
	- jack up my ticket prices from $27 to $38 in two years (not that I'm
		going to pay 120 bucks for 3 seats. I'll probably next to the

	- not tell me my priority #
	- not let me sell my priority #
	- in order for me to get the free jacket, force me to order my tickets
		for next season before I get to select my section

	- not let me park at the new arena after paying for their
		privileged parking lot (which was sometimes full when
		I got there) for 2 straight years.

I've been a loyal ticket holder, since day 1 (literally) in spring of
'90 when the team was announced.  and I'm not getting that loyalty
returned. Wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison. And
Pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all.

I know one isn't suppose to make negative comments on signatures, but
what did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the "Stay in Edmonton"

watching the Shark's beat them.

Though you can certaily assert all this, I don't see why it necessarily
has to be the case. Why can't hate just stay as it is, and not beget more?
Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. I admit
this happens, but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily
so.

Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred?

Certainly we should love even our enemies. Amos 5:15 says to hate the evil
and love the good. This can't contradict Christ's teaching. I think we tie
up both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be
considered more objectively. Surely I don't fly into a rage at every sin
I see, but why can I not "hate" it?

I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported.
A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which
were protected by the Greek police. Photographs of Greek policemen 
preventing Turks from this non brain minority were all over Greek press.

  The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared
  Memory Extension to X. Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms
  I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the
  shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an
  extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to
  test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
  in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this
  transparent.
  As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting.
  The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this
  code can Email me.

If you can modify the design of the DTMF decoder, the ideal comunications
would be over a multi-drop system, like RS-485.  RS-485 boards are available
for PC's, probably cheaper than a bunch of RS-232 channels, and RS-485 is
cheaper to build onto your satellite modules, using only a single supply
8-pin DIP driver chip.  Software at the PC end would be similarly complex
for either RS-232 or RS-485, in my opinion.  The higher data rates possible
with RS-485 would permit quasi-simultaneous data transmission.
Hope this helps.

Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to 
serial port weirdness.  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX
handheld.  Everything else worked okay on that port, but not the HP. (it runs
on two penlite batteries).  It turned out that the plus (by accident or by 
design flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing 
weird things to the HP (which has only 3v dc!).  The HP worked fine when 
connected to the printer port.  

Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device?  Have you 
tried using the printer port?

Good luck.

I recently watched a an episode of "The Old West" a TV show on the 
Discovery Channel (or perhaps the A&E Network), the one hosted by Kenny
Rogers.  This episode was all about the Mormons and how they settled Utah,
etc.

A large portion of the broadcast was about the "Mountain Meadows Massacre".
The program very specifically pointed out that Brigham Young knew nothing
about the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph), and
it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn
settlers into what amounted to a mob.  All participants in the incident were
prosecuted and eccomunicated from the LDS Church.

I suggest you watch a rerun of that episode (they play them over and over) 
and see what they (non-Mormons) have to say about it.

Subject: SJ Mercury's reference to Fundamentalist Christian parents
Organization: Representing my own views here.
Lines: 23

In the Monday, May 10 morning edition of the San Jose Mercury News an
article by Sandra Gonzales at the top of page 12A explained convicted
killer David Edwin Mason's troubled childhood saying,

	"Raised in Oakland and San Lorenzo by strict fundamentalist
	Christian parents, Mason was beaten as a child.  He once was
	tied to a workbench and gagged with a cloth after he accidently
	urinated on his mother when she walked under his bedroom window,
	court records show."

Were the San Jose Mercury news to come out with an article starting with
"Raised in Oakland by Mexican parents, Mason was beaten...", my face would
be red with anger over the injustice done to my Mexican family members and
the Mexican community as a whole.  I'm sure Sandra Gonzales would be equally
upset.

Why is it that open biggotry like this is practiced and encouraged by the
San Jose Mercury News when it is pointed at the christian community?

Can a good christian continue to purchase newspapers and buy advertising in
this kind of a newspaper?  This is really bad journalism.

I'm upset.

Folks,

It's time to start building some precise questions to send to our
federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our
local TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be
asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation
at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake
up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth
from the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging 
at my gut.  The list will probably grow. 

1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that
     the BATF obtained?

2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition
     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a "no-knock"
     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the 
     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without 
     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock 
     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant 
     in a manner prescribed by law?

3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents
     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.
     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building
     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.
     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an
     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to
     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening
     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 

4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that
     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over
     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the
     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms
     License, were they actively participating in the legal business
     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the
     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence
     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally
     dispossessed weapons.

5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,
     a BATF spokeswoman stated "We were outgunned!".  Yet, TV newscasts
     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents
     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the
     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's
     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)
     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the 
     scene of the original assault on the complex?

6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the
     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a "hostage"
     situation? 

7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use "psychological warfare"
     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and
     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any 
     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the 
     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?

8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex
     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable
     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away
     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers
     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?

9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch
     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members
     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an 
     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a 
     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident 
     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the 
     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  
     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle 
     penetrated?

10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and
     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,
     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas
     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any
     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI
     have that a mass suicide pact existed?

11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on
     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition
     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be
     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas
     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence 
     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition 
     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,
     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were 
     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the
     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect
     for someone engaged in such a legal business?

12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical
     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to
     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is 
     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will 
     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?

13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the
     complex, "over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles."  On the video
     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles
     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one
     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no 
     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,
     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be 
     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  
     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, 
     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be 
     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do 
     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas 
     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by 
     shots from high-power rifles?

14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United
     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use
     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use
     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally
     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?

15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered
     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had
     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county
     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet
     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within
     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?

      Now, for more AAMMMAAAAZZZZZZIINNNNGGGGG Predictions!

	   Ooops.  They ALREADY DID it.
          
	   Okay, then.  The NST will be raised from 5% to 7% by 1996.

      ii)  Unemployment will rise!

      iii)  Tax revenues will decline.  Deficit will increase!
	    We'll get another DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE by 1997!
	    Everyone will DANCE AND SING!

      Yup.  I'm gonna <glancing at watch> bail out of here

Have you tried the library?
Since you go to WPI (so do I), go to AK and look on the first floor, a 
professor has posted an IEEE (i believe) spec sheet on the 68060 which
is around 10 pages long.  I'm sure the library has the info you request, It's
just a matter of finding it.


Hope this helps,

The PowerBook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.  Nor does the 140.
The Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook 100 had one.  I don't
know about the newer PowerBooks, but I kind of doubt it.  I got bit by
this too, and it took my a while rooting around on the developer CD

The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system
7 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC?  I
recall there being a conversation here that a 486/25 running Windows benchmarks
at about the same speed as 25Mhz 030 in system 7.  I don't know if that is
true, but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this.

What sadist brought up this vein about Malarchuk?  When I saw what
happened I wanted to throw up, and at the same time I was devastated,
since I thought that Malarchuk wouldn't survive.  BTW, I believe he picked
up an alcohol problem after (before?) the incident.

To radically change the subject, the Caps must be having nightmares about
the Isles in overtime in the playoffs.  Have they *ever* beaten the
Islanders in a playoff OT game?  This is lunacy.  The Caps are such a
sorry team in the playoffs, they consistently choke against opponents who
they should be beating.  Losing two OT games in a row is not coincidence,
it's evidence of the choke factor.

Subject: Cannot create 24 plane window
Organization: Niels Bohr Institute and Nordita, Copenhagen
Lines: 59

    Hello X'ers

I have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. The
following code illustrates the problem:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/Xutil.h>

main()
{
        Display *display;
        Window win;
        XVisualInfo vinfo;
        Colormap colormap;
        XSetWindowAttributes attributes;
        XEvent event;
        Status status;

        display=XOpenDisplay(NULL);
        status=XMatchVisualInfo(display,DefaultScreen(display),24,TrueColor,
                &vinfo);
        if (!status){
                fprintf(stderr,"Visual not found\n");
                exit(1);
        }
        colormap=XCreateColormap(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),
                vinfo.visual,AllocNone);

        attributes.colormap=colormap;

        win=XCreateWindow(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),0,0,100,100,
                0,24,InputOutput,vinfo.visual,CWColormap,&attributes);
        XMapWindow(display,win);
        for (;;){
                XNextEvent(display,&event);
        }
}

I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP
9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change),
both running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on
HP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the
combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request.

Summary: What might a vasectomy do to a female partner's long-term health?

Does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of a
man's vasectomy on his female partner?

I've seen plenty of study results about vasectomy's effects on men's health,
but what about women? 

For example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for,
say, cervical cancer?  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies?  Changes in the
vagina's pH?  Yeast or bacterial infections?

Outside of study results, how about informed speculation?

Thanks in advance for your help!

The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file
that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands
for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.

There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually
named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most
GL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes
of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some
copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one there
a long time ago).

I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part
about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that
the important part of what the original poster said was the bit
about killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the
sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw
it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others
might see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit
strong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:

was unnecessary.

Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
anti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech
on why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're
reading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not
true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets
thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the
state of Israel.

Anyway, I'd rather be somewhere else, so I'm outta this thread.

I agree about the durability of the old TH400 trannies from GM.  While I 
never intentionally slamed my '68 Firebird 400 ci Conv. into gear, I would leave 
the trannie in Low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires 
grabbed, take off.  When I reached about 57-60mph the turbo 400 Auto would 
shift to S (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about 10 to 15 foot of double 
stripped rubber on the ground.  Most everyone I knew at the time was quite 
impressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine.
Motor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with large
chains.  Oh yea,FYI:    Pontiac 400 ci bored 0.04 over

Several years ago I tried to commit a patient who was growing Salmonella out of his
stool, blood, and an open ulcer for treatment. The idea was that the guy was a
walking public health risk, and that forcing him to receive IV antibiotics for
a few days was in the public interest. I will make a long story short by saying
that the judge laughed at my idea, yelled at me for wasting his time, and let
the guy go.

I found out that tuberculosis appears to be the only MEDICAL (as oppsed to psychiatric)
condition that one can be committed for, and this is because very specific laws were
enacted many years ago regarding tb. I am certain these vary from state to state.

Any legal experts out there to help us on this?

Why are circuit boards green?  The material used to make them goes by two
names.  If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR-4.  The same
material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a
structural material and is called G-10.  FR-4 and G-10 are both green.  They
are not green because of a solder masking agent.  The basic ingredients are
a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  I am not sure what the specs are on
the resin, but if you are really curious you can call NEMA (National
Electronics Manufacturing Association) or Ciba Geigy (a major manufacturer
of epoxy resins) to find out.  As an aside, I occasionally mix clear epoxy
and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments.
The proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in G-10.  They are
the same green color.

Sure.  Why keep using oil?  A hydrogen/electric economy would likely be

Well, yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark
a lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that "popular
usage" is not always sufficient excuse.  

In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found
in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or 
mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably
not.  

The same is true of X.  "The X Window System", "X", "X11", and related
monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a
proper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact 
that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  

As for the trade publications that promulgate things like "X Window" or
"X.windows" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, 
consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by 
*journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't
be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust
a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?

Popular usage is as it may be, but I for one am all for holding people
who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.

You're reading far too much into this (aside from the obvious fact
that you shouldn't hold anybody to what they wrote in a 10 year old
book in a rapidly changing field like this.)


Quite simply she says that the security should not DEPEND on the
secrecy of the algorithm.  A secret algorithm can still be secure,
after all, we just don't know it.  Only our level of trust is
affected, not the security of the system.

The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know, which we believe to
be secure.

They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to
protect its security.  They want to protect its market share.

If they publish the algorithm, then shortly manufacturers would
make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not
use a key stored in escrow.  And of course, everybody would buy them.


The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that
you can only use if you follow their rules, they get us to follow
their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and
nail.

Quite simply, with Clipper established, it would be much harder for
another encryption maker to define a new standard, to make phones that
can't talk to the leading phone companies.   The result is tappable
cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds, for 99% of the
populace.


To get untappable crypto, you would have to build a special phone that
runs on top of this system, and everybody you talk to would have to
have an indentical one.

That's the chicken and egg of crypto.  The government is using its
very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new
technologies to control this one in a way they like.


It's almost admirably clever.  When the EFF started, I posed the question here
"What are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they
can't wiretap?" and nobody here had an answer (or even thought it was
much of a question)

Then came the backdoor and Digital Telephony bills, which we fought.

Now we have their real answer, the cleverest of all.

Hell, just set up a spark jammer, or some other _very_ electrically-noisy
device. Or build an active Farrady cage around the room, with a "noise"
signal piped into it. While these measures will not totally mask the
emissions of your equipment, they will provide sufficient interference to
make remote monitoring a chancy proposition, at best. There is, of course,
the consideration that these measures may (and almost cretainly will)
cause a certain amount of interference in your own systems. It's a matter
of balancing security versus convenience.

Telecommunications/Cryptographic Equipment Technician.

  I really think that this is the key point.  When I saw the incident on
Baseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn't believe how far away from the plate
Gant went.  Then he casually leaned against his bat.  I don't blame the 
umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.

  The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the
field.  What were they going to do, attack the umpire?  The only people
who should've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players.
I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for
having no control over his team.

No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when
(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.
The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max
Friz's famous design, but with an overhead "point cam" (see below for
more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground
clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so
that the ground clearance was substantially increased:


      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)
                 Viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/

This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved
around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn
in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting
rods to accomodate the stroke.

The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still
unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and
and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was
required to drive both overhead valves.

Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a
pressurized stream of oil to power the "waterwheel" which kept the lobe
spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal
engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to
normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,
resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a
little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the
beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to
pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,
uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).

Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively
firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily
lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even
higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This
was feasible because it was a racing engine.

With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers
because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an
almost perfect point:

                    /\
                   /()\   <-lobe
                  / XX \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to
 valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity)
                |  |   | |
                |  |===| |
                    =0=  <---piston
                     |
                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical
                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the
                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the
                             curvature because there was none in the
                             head itself. The bore curve would start
                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in
                             this diagram


The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of
the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of
finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the
name.

The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it
worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary
technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that
racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines
were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate
(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two
Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and
down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as
twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern
record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle
historians discount this story.

No. I estimate a 99 % probability the Gehrels referred to

Maybe in the 24th century they could do gamma ray spectroscopy on

Gulf has changed the third parts's perception of Arabs.
1. Before, people tended to think Arabs have tough character. After seeing
Iraqis begging for surrender, people do not gave Arabs much weight.
2. People tended to think Arabs are a united people in fighting Isrealis.
After Gulf War, seeing some Arab nations beated up Iraqis in order to
waiver the debt to U.S. and Kuwaitis consistly trying to draw West nations
to hit Iraq again, people started to see Arab World as a dog cage, echoing
sound of barking.

The whole "saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia" was nothing but US State
Department propeganda.  Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the 
British created Kuwait.  They were trying to recover land they believed
was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.  The Kuwaitis pushed
just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle
the dispute the old fashioned way...
Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq
together and concentrated on taking out Saddam.  A strong, united Iraq with
an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of
the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf.
But of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy...

The US had no problem killing tens of thousands of ill-equipted Iraqi soldiers,
including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions
from the air in defense of Kuwaiti oil, but it has yet to lift a finger against
Bosnian Serbs while they slaughter Bosnian muslims....

My girlfriend just started taking Imitrex for her migraine headaches.  Her
neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound
headaches due to daily doses of analgesics.  She stopped taking all
analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15).  The weekend was pretty
bad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours.
 Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on
Friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick.  Skin
was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  It subsided
in an hour or so.  Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to
control the pain.  Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain
for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  A friend
of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused
heart attacks in several people.  Apparently the mild chest pains were
common in these other people prior to there attacks.  Is this just rumor? 
Has anyone else heard of these symptoms?  My girlfriend also has Mitral

It's the applications that do this.  Unfortunately, even the applets

Solitaire, for example).

None that I know of.  If an application doesn't give back the

Windows.

If the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them

about it.

There are books written on this one.  In general, just be sure to free
up everything that you ask for before you exit.  Unfortunately, I

there's no way to avoid this entirely.

There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages
to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on

My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.

  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.
  (Ps. 32:1).

and quoted by the apostle Paul:

  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
  imputeth righteousness without works,
  Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
  are covered.
  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)

The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are
parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational
distinction is unwarranted.

I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is
going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for
millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver
was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting
speculation, though.

I'll leave comments on the so-called "bema seat" vs. "throne" judgments to
someone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala
dispensationalism.

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel.
I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to
comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites). 
Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.

Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places
on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before
I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the
Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite
limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has
to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing
on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.

Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:

Hi,

I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running 
SunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment
variables (like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc) in my .login file.  With xdm,
the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm
root-window nor my applications know about these variables.

I used the "DisplayManager._0.userPath" resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config
to succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession
but that didn't help.  I also tried using
	"DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH"
which didn't work either.

I would appreciate any help on this matter.

Thanks in advance,
Shash

Hello all,

I know that after market sunroofs may have left a bad taste in some of  
your mouths, but I am really interested in finding a "good" brand if one  
exists.  Please let me know if you have heard of any makers with a good
reputation (few failures, no leaks, that sort of thing) and whether or
not you have had first hand experience with that manufacturer.  Who is
generally regarded in the industry as the "best" (price no object) maker  
of power sunroofs??

I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to
Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage
says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the
Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho
for Jesus and may be authentic.
   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which
lack the references.

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but
I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes
this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus.)

I assumed he was referring to OS/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while DOS
(and therefore Windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing.  As a programmer, I
agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things.  It's annoying, too.
But when just a Windows user, I don't think about it much.  And, I doubt many
other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document,
calcing a spreadsheet, etc...It works and they get their work done.

Just a neutral comment:
It's funny, I think, how arguments about Windows vs OS/2 sound so very
similar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that.
It's somehow very personal to people.  Convictions are irrational and
there's nothing wrong with that--it's just...interesting.

Therein lies the rub.  The HD slash cut, or baloney cuts as some call
them, ARE NOT STOCK mufflers.  They're sold for "off-road use only,"

Terry, hi.  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E.  I can't
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me
a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using
the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works.

I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they
have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service
lines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.

I remember seeing an artical on large-engine oil

the life of the oil was to run through a heated
un-presurized chamber to allow water and volitiles
to boil off. This made such long-term usage of

Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits
wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M
bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,
which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I
believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

I have a wonderful encrypter you can borrow that converts a message
eg "Meet me at 11:30 to bomb the White House. Bring some dynamite"
to an apparently (relatively) innoculous message. This message
here is an example of the output for the above message :-).

>It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.

It is shockiong that it could happen anywhere.
It is shocking that it could happen in a country 
that has the arrogance to call itself free.

What you can do:
	(1) Write to your congress person in plain text.
	(2) Write to your congress person in encrypted text.
		(decrypter optional)
	(3) Send some random keystroked to your congressperson
	(4) Send some random keystrokes accross the US boundaries,
		and keep the spooks busy trying to decode it.
	(5) Write your own encryption algorithms.
	(6) Don't buy clipper products.

P.S. I can't work out why the US government doesn't want to sell
them overseas. After all, they are rather easy for US interests to decode,
so make a perfect tool for industrial/military espionage...lulling 
anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security. You will
notice that there is NO mention anywhere about safety for non-Americans.

Disclaimer: My opinions are mine alone, and do not represent anyone elses.
I have nothing that I particularly want to hide at the moment...though I 
consider the right
to be able to use whatever method of coding data I like to be high on my
list of priorities.

Secondly, Bonds and Clark (in that order) are a lot more productive with

You're right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey don't even begin
to compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets so
much attention.

Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was
terrible.  So was his sophomore year.

National League pitchers are "much better pitchers"?  That certainly explains
Sheffield's 1993, hm?  Are you confusing "have ERA's that are 0.40 lower
because they don't face DH's" with "much better"?

EPS _IS_ plain postscript. It is only wrapped by some comments and stripped
of any dubious commands for compatibility. You can simply do

%!

save gsave
/showpage {} def

% Include eps file here

grestore restore

showpage

% end of file

and this way show it on it's natural page position and size.

Programs may use the %%BoundingBox: comment in the EPS file to do
arbitrary scale, rotate and translate to include it in more complicated
ways than above.

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.

OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,
is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar.

Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It 
probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a 
better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.
You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it.

Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.
Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski
or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try
one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,
a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
countersteering.

Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what
real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations
of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm 
willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. 

If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's
behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.

One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it

Atoms are not objective.  They aren't even real.  What scientists call
an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes 
certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All
of which is subjective.  

What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist 
takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There
is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach
which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective
in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that
he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.

This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an
objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on
morality.  But there exists no objective morality.

Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of 
the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion
is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).

Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes
of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our
surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what
we can _say_ about the physical world.

How do you know? Were you there?

While obviously Koresh was a nut case, the (typical) inability of the
government/media to get its story straight is quite disturbing. On
tuesday night, NBC news reported that the FBI did not know the place
was burning down until they saw black smoke billowing from the
building. The next day, FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidians
setting the fire. The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possible
their battery of the compound's wallks could have accidentally set the
blaze, while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigating
of the site because it was still too hot. So how did they KNOW they
didnt accidentally set the fire.

Sounds like the FBI just burned the place to the ground to destroy
evidence to me.

	While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal
agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order, there is 
still a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform
a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly
incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the
FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems
to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This moves
a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.
	The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade
people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  A
national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political 
viewpoints.

Hi.

I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name)
was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.
They are.  There's a space between each link where the "teeth" of the 
locking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.

Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks "LOOK" a lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial
appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-
cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally 
functional.

Finally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and
the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain
dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give
me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially
inflammatory action at stoplights.

I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur.
(I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on my
body) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).

I have found that you should observe the following with almost all new
equipment :

Check for warrany tape.  If none, carefully open unit.

Inspect for loose wires, jumpers, screws, and other trash.

Clean up these manufacturing mistakes.

*Now* power up the unit and check it out.

I can't think of how many things I've bought that weren't okay right out of
the box due to sloppy QC.

I'm here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly

sense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either.  I 
am a die-hard Ranger fan (I guess I have to be - I sat in the

of them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has
been totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this

Hurlbut was injured for quite a while.  I'm not sure, but I

I believe Kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation

that reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is
not doing any REAL physical intimidation (I'd like to have a nickel

you've got to at least have some illusions ;-(

I agree and I don't know.

Sorry, I don't agree with you here.  I think Joey C. did a good
job filling in when he was asked to.  I can't imagine that it's
easy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  I don't
seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too
much, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at
least didn't make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an
interview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.

The man is awesome.  In a way, I'm enjoying the playoffs more,

all the glory Mario is getting without 'hating' him because he's
on the opposing team.  He deserves it all, as far as I'm
concerned.

Carrying in the glove box is not covered...I'm not sure what I was 
thinking there. It _is_ legal in Oklahoma. 

On inter-state travel, as long as it is legal for you to own
at your point of origination and destination, the gun is carried
in a locked compartment/box (glove box specifically excluded) separate
from the ammo, it is legal under Title 19, Chapter 44, Section 94(9? I
forget, and my copy of the regs is at home) of the US Code. This,
unfortunately, has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a
certain state (which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly
stupid) under that state's law.

Gee, and I thought Federal Law overrode state law...

Yes, he does.  BUT, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there!  When
I played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would
scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  I don't care if he's
in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball!
(Yes, roller hockey, remember)  And if there was nobody around to clear
the slot, then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*. 
I *hate* people in my way when I'm the goalie, and I am sure Felix does
too.  I should say that I didn't see the incident, so if Potvin really
swung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people
out of the way.  He's a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)

I have an event handler working for a ButtonPressMask like:

but I would like to be able to have two types of actions: one to occur
with the left mouse, the other the right, and perhaps one with the
middle.  So my event handler would look more like:


  XtAddEventHandler( plot_data->display, left-ButtonPressMask, FALSE,
                    show_left_mouse_position, plot_data);

  XtAddEventHandler( plot_data->display, right-ButtonPressMask, FALSE,
                    show_right_mouse_position, plot_data);

However I don't know how to make my left-ButtonPressMask.  There didn't seem
to be one in the event mask lists I had on hand (although Button1MotionMask
looked promising).  My references also mentioned using "|" to or two

Any help would be appreciated.

Indeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:

  26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often
  since the foundation of the world; but now once at
  the consummation He has been manifested to put away 
  sin by the sacrifice of Himself.

  27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die
  once, and after this comes judgement;

  28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear
  the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to
  bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.


The first point is that this verse is part of an even larger
context, the subject of which is not the destiny of the
individual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ's
sacrifice, "once", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen 
mankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his 
"Christianity and Reincarnation".  The thrust of the passage
in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and 
sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual 
experience of the human being after death.  The "once" 
is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity 
of Christ's deed.  One thing for certain it does is to 
refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than 
once.  But the comparison to the human experience - die 
once, then judgement (note: not "the judgement", but just 
"judgement".  The word for judgement is "krisis".

Hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense
of the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this
point, I would just emphasize again that the  passages 
that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably
they are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial
of reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of
Hebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,
namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after
death.

What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially
silent about the fate of the individual human being between death
and the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly
be interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And
there are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-
tion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.

We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that
might have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.
But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach
to the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist
and "new age" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular
incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ
as the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for
his deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;
the redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of
the body, and the Last Judgement.

Taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely
different perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their
sins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to 
works, the meaning of "deathbed conversion", the meaning of the
sacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all
those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that
the discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion
one that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and 
Redeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such 
as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian
doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.

There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible 
does not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ
also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know
in the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) 
could not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in
knowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole
of humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth
in the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify
all spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel
of the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the
greater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, 
not the end of man's sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and
the New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.

1950's.

"The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didn't
want the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was hefting
nearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his
skull.", notes Gillow in his report. "There are whole  laboratories in
the  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow
experiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400's is now
scientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea
started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary
transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats." Gillow is quick
to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the
disappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.

"When it becomes time to replace the pope", says Gillow, "The old pope
and the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber. They  butt
heads much  like  male yaks  fighting for dominance of the  herd.  The
victor emerges and has  earned the privilege of inseminating the choir
boys."

if you have a memory card installed that's not one of apple's, this

  Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing
all over late-night TV recently? I was wondering if they use forced air, heat,
or both. If there's heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at?
My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay >$100.00 for a box, a fan
and a heater. Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together
for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?

I grew up listening to Harry Carey call the Cardinals' games and
really liked him--then. But, as I recall, he was fired because
he was too critical (read: honest) when he was announcing. He
dared to point out the Cards' miscues and such. At least, this is

Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully
up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different
manufacturer's synonyms):

------
In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view
of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my
views on things like availability and backward compatibility):

74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively
	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball
	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.

74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher
	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.

74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.
	Very obsolete; use CMOS.

74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in
	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.

74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower
	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of
	devices.

74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high
	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.

74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things
	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.

74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly
	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.

74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with
	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer
	CMOS 74 families.

4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS
	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low
	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.
	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,
	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).
	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The
	clear choice when speed is not important.

74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power
	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for
	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.
	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of
	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power
	consumption at faster speeds.

74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read
	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility
	in CMOS involves some compromises.

10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources
	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for
	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow
	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,
	can be expensive.

100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and
	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.

As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and
74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices
you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just
have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible
with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of
hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.
10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.

Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are
interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.

Golly, I love stupid people. :-)
Listen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,
there exist these things called "ties".  A tie occurs when a game ends
with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. 
There also exits these things called "wins".  A win is when one team has a
higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other
at a time, so I can say "the opponent".)  A team gets two points for a
win.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10
ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The
first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86
points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number
of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,
Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then
that's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the
tiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teams
had the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,
maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.
:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)

Note that this doesn't affect all concealed carry.  (Look after the
word "except".)  It always helps to read the law before commenting on
it.

Would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed?  How about someone at
home?  Note that both are legal, and a lot of "common" people qualify
for one or the other.

Some of us not-so judgmental little shits don't drive/ride when we're

I really think you are comparing apples and oranges. Nobody disputes
that OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an 
individual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that
question. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2
and I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse
set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my
work. Go to your local computer store to answer this one.
I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. This
is where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has won
the single user PC war the next one will be the client server
war and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0.
Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be
attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II'
of the war. Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure 
is fun watching and arguing about it tho.

I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I saw
live that would have to be up there (up where? there!).  
1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981.
It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter.
Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee
warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP,
Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that
time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into 
Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing.
Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost
came back though...
2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so
far.
and
3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left
the stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!

store and reply of mouse and keyboard events
--------------------------------------------

To produce regression tests or automatic demo's
we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events
produced by a user. It should be possible to filter
the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue
an to store them in a file.
This sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given 
to the server's queue as if a user is working.


1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all
   mouse and keyboard events (where)?

2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?
   In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).
   Where can we catch all events coming from a given
   server.
   If this is not possible, can we catch all events given
   to a certain client and how ?
   
3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?
   Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages
   all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ?


Thanks in advance

I firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was
only deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason
what kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I 
had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil's attempts to 
destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy
to achieve the same mental states at will. 

My faith was just learned fear in a disguise.

: Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.

God is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years?
If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief -
what it was in my case - I'd rather quit. If god does not help me to
keep the faith, I can't go on. 

Besides, I am concerned with god's morality and mental health. Does
she really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations,
guidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn't
she make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who
refuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture
for those who can't believe?

I love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me,
she'll know what to do.

Your argument is of the type "you'll know once you try".
Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed
for many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that 
they had lived in a virtual reality.

What else but reason I can use? I don't have the spiritual means 
Christians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible.
I don't even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my
body - indeed, I _am_ this body. When it goes up with flames, so
does my identity. God can entertain herself with copies of me
if she wants.

: To learn you must accept that which you don't know.

What does this mean? To learn you must accept that you don't know 
something, right-o. But to learn you must _accept_ something I don't
know, why? This is not the way I prefer to learn. It is unwise to
merely swallow everything you read. Suppose I write a book telling
how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn (tm) has helped me in my
daily problems, would you accept this, since you can't know whether
it is true or not?

Note that the GIPU is also omnipotent, omnipresent, and loves just
about everyone. Besides, He (and She) is guiding every writer on this planet,
you and me, and not just some people who write legendary stories

Your god is just one aspect of His and Her Presence.

Well, there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates
that OTO has been around since at least the late 1800s, long before
Crowley ever heard of it, how long has AMORC been around? (yes, I know
that they claim to have existed as an organization clear into prehistory,
but I doubt that they have any organizational paperwork
as a non-profit that can be carbon-dated to 20,000 BC)

  This is the latest from UPI 

     Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told journalists Turkey was
     closing its air space to all flights to and from Armenia and would
     prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across
     Turkish territory.

  
   Historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited 
   signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian
   populations. Even the Nazis did this much.

   It seems as though from now on Turkey will publicly pronounce 
   themselves 'hypocrites' should they choose to continue their
   condemnation of the Serbians.

Maybe I can help you. He's a major league coach with the Rockies.
So above prediction is doubly wrong.

My prediction: The Red Sox-Cubs Series and Vikings-Broncos SuperBore will
occur at the end of the world.

And one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 3.50.

Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of
all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various
biases. 

But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again, 
to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.

My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how* 
you come about developing it.

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic
of the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I
think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the 
business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic 
assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific
research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis
and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than 
"the old Newtonian model of the world".  And I doubt that many psychologists
would appreciate being put outside this empirical "world view".  Psychology
also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. 

>It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be

>that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle. 

Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-
tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually 
found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will 
have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  
There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of
knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own 
discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,
even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come
to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had 
a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and 
tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting
science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a 
creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally
turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  

Again, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by "science".  I often
don't recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science
is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They
portray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH
in big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,
turn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-
tion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very human
process.

I've had PRK.

I would suggest asking a doctor about contacts. Mine said yes to
contacts. I think the scars from RK would preclude contacts.

No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to
8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress
chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the
cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't
cut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.

I find my vision is more clear for some things, and less clear for
others, only at night. I notice a definite haloing at night in the
darkness when I look at automobile headlamps, though this is not
something I spend inordinate amounts of time doing. For ordinary
things, my vision, in particular having a fully-operating peripheral
vision, is clearer than with glasses, or contacts.

Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always
see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many
fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination.

Absolute nonsense.  The decision that was made was Pocklington's.  He chose 
20 mill over Gretzky.  If Gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win
a cup in LA then I submit that he wasn't worth the 20 mill.

How do you know what he thinks (or thought)?  The only "thought" that I
can see that you have revealed is your own.  You don't like Gretzky.
Big deal.

The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty.  What
the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the
ref won't be fooled.  I can't imagine why anyone would expect someone like
Lemieux to change his game.  Why don't you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated
type like Hull and Salami.

Keywords: youths drugs LSD inhalants
Lines: 62


The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14,
1993 issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up At Younger Age" by Mike
Snider, p. 1A).

    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -
    usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue
    and air fresheners, says a new survey.

    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds
    "statistically significant increases" in eighth-graders' use of
    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.

    "We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing
    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters
    adolescence," says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief
    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and
    Human Services.

    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long
    decline.

    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the
    following in the 30 days before they were polled:

        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;
                         cocaine 1.3%.

    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants
    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.

    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%
    over 1991. 

    * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%
    tried it in the last year.

    Reducing drug use among students "requires a different kind of
    strategy" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part
    of an overall illness prevention plan.

    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders
    disapprove of them.

    "It's scary," Shalala says.  "Dealers are focusing on younger, more
    vulnerable kids."

Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case
with no solution that worried me.

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere 
that they are on the surface of.
Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the
surface of.

These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design
meet these problems neatly.

When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear
the algorithm should afil or return infinite R.
When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities
they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)
they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.

This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point
by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced

it can also be achieved by

If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. 

It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.
The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.
(4 points being colinear => coplanar)

Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points
has been found is trivial.

From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together

I don't deny this fact.

The thrust of my argument here is that 

(a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found
guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is
wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.

(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps
have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is
_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and
_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important 
distinction.

I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say "Muslim".  In
general, anyone who calls themselves a "Muslim" and does not do or 
outwardly profess
something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam
is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to
Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a
Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential
principles, though, then one does leave Islam.

The term "Muslim" is to be contrasted with "Mu'min", which means "true
believer".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is
something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you
will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,
because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,
for example, am a "true believer" or not.  For example, I could just be
putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to
what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say "Muslims"
we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in
practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By
"Muslim" we do not necessarily mean "Mu'min", or "true believer" in
Islam.

No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings.
I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists

>If you fall, for example,

Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is
supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.
(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under
the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe
manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their
trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.

> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of

The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I
can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large
negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that
the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the
number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the
described circumstance) is near zero.

>I can find the figures if you don't believe me.

Please do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at
context.  Make sure that your source excludes other types of
accidents and suicides that are misreported.  ("Gun cleaning
accident" is police-speak for "the family needs the insurance
money.")

I think that you are changing the meaning of "values" here. Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.

value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as
of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or
lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound. 

In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms
of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing.

In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the
word "value" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard
of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on
systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a
scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as
"objective values."

Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.
Just because the word "values" is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts.

If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
the meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.

So, back to the original question:

And objective morality is.....?

If you can provide an objective foundation for "morality" then that will
be a good beginning.

For the information of those not "lucky" enough to live in the city of
Austin, TX, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks,
it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  This is an ordinance
unique (I think) to the city of Austin.

Freon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2X cost here.
Recovered freon is not required to be "purchased" from the car it is
withdrawn from.  As a matter of practice, some shops here are charging 
a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it 
is reintroduced to the system.

Just another quality service from an _Enviornmentally Conscious_ city.

I agree with you Harry, however you must also concede then that
Arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war.  remember that the
Palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in
order to further their cause.  If Irgun had to attack civilian
targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some
objective, I'm sure they would have done so.  I also don't
exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism.
The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with
regards to Palestine, and the Irgun and branch off groups made
a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and
fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued
presence in Palestine.  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me,
and not much removed from Arab terrorism.  We must not also
forget that Irgun, or Irgun branch off groups [more likely]
killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or
who cooperated with the British.  
	I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but
I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they
were a bit screwed.

Summary: let's talks stats and not "stats"

Note:  I'm not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard,
but as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some things
that Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as
"sampling" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what
I want to say.

maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes:

There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball
team and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In the
biology context, we would very likely read "fitness" for "the score of
the game" and "organisms" for "teams".  How we interpret "players" is
trickier, but either "organs", or "genes" might seem reasonable
choices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A "genes"
interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, 
but that would be a different and probably longer post.

If, however, we take the "organ" view, then our knowledge of biology
should make us pause before we start saying things like "species X is
more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z".  Given what we
know about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious
of such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often
made when you map "species X" onto 'humans', and "organ Z" onto
'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem
more reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'
above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross
pathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).

Even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the
functioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ
might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.
(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial
in some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any
kind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is
not some completely magical unanalyzable "whole" but an intriguing
process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are
potentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to
particular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple
organs.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I
think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved
in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.

>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-
>solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
>in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.

One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly
controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of
course, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they
can, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the
absence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,
but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.

>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens
>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a

In this cases, we're seeing the word "statistics" means "summary of
observed events", where the events themselves can be viewed as the
output of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.
Thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together
into the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might
give us a basis to test particular hypotheses.

>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the

>measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.

This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.
Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;
you might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to
baseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an
environment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least
a nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the
league, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any
of their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly
large random component in the performance of each team that is
difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors
intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in
biology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the
World Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component
may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,
and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement
where they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but
it's unclear what it all really means.

***

Now just one more un-related point:

>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a
>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.

On the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the
outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of
teams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this
better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.
But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule
gives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference
between the winners and the losers.

Moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World
Series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict
the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only
to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.

>The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it.  There is no new
>knowledge being produced.  

Since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the
events you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to
understand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new
knowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and
useful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge
in a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge
even though I'm relying on stats to do it.

Do you mean that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior in _some_ respects (which

I have seen Copper Bracelet by the name of Sabona created by Dr. John

Bracelet in dealing with Arthritis. 

I know in one case a 70-year old person developed bruise at the base of her
left thumb after wearing the copper bracelet on her left wrist for several
months.  She was told the bruise is "normal" and would disappear. 

Is the bruise reason to be concerned?
Should the person discontinued wearing the copper bracelet?
Could anyone kindly point me to literature on copper bracelet?
What are the other information on copper bracelet?

Your response would be very much appreciated.

Not really. Most of the prophesies aren't even prophesies. They're prayers

Depends on what you mean by "for a living".  1974 was the year he led the
league in pinch-hit at bats with 50, but he'd been getting a lot of PH ABs
earlier than that, and was never a full-time player.  20-35 PH ABs early in
his career, 15-20 a year just before going to the Dodgers, and 30-50 in the
peak years.

We're talking about a guy with a 20-year career as an outfielder, a .300+
career batting average, and 1130 or so career hits.

I received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on

I don't think speed has been determined, since it has never run on Intel chips.

I don't think Impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration.

In terms of features, and learning curve... ALL that you stated for 3DS is also
true for Imagine, and lots more... But I'll have to admit that after 3 years of

I'm no defender of the AEC, but it is worth noting that it is unfair to tar

Dr. Ray's political agenda is well-known and documented.  Likewise, her

Just a shot here, but ya never know:

I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player 
at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  For a 
while, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the 
amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder 
joints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  
I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably 
lousy heat sinking.

You said "a nice Alpine" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher

Yeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted.  You somehow left 
out the part about "we all ate the same thing."  Changes things a bit, eh?

You complain that people blame MSG automatically, since it's an unknown and
therefore must be the cause.  It is equally (if not more) unreasonable to
defend it, automatically assuming that it CAN'T be the culprit.

I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many
verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been
shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)
Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion
of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well
as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses
and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We
must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the
interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with
them.

Subject: Radar detector DETECTORS?
Organization: Virginia's Public Education Network (Richmond)
Lines: 50

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was "no way!" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?
  Are any brands "quieter" than others?

Fellow netters,

I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there (even outside of Iowa).  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting
space, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"
posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while.

After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a
request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50
in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded
more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. 
Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a
message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed
the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and
assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He
sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a
transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him
to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times
to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for
my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the
deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's
best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat
you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my
software from him.

Bravo, Mr. Miller!

Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just
tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying
to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to
go the 'right' way on the energy curve).  Now, where *did* I put those
sackcloth and ashes?

[I was not and am not 'pretending' anything; I am *so* pleased you are
not surprised, though.]

>No, it is nothing like perpetual motion.  

Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it
sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was "sounds almost like
perpetual motion", which I, at least, consider a somewhat different
propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should
beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?

I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the
trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different 'run' for each
actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
(relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs,
technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this
one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible
and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable
approach? 

And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with
something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would
really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power
with and without the energy recovery.  Are we talking ounces, pounds,
or tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you SI fans) of
material and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days,
weeks, months or years, for you SI fans -- hmmm, still using a
non-decimated time scale, I see  ;-))?

I haven't seen any mention of this in a while, so here goes...

When the Hubble Telescope was first deployed, one of its high gain antennas
was not able to be moved across its full range of motion.  It was suspected
that it had been snagged on a cable or something.  Operational procedures
were modified to work around the problem, and later problems have overshadowed
the HGA problem.

Is there any plan to look at the affected HGA during the HST repair mission,
to determine the cause of its limited range of motion?  Is the affected HGA
still limited, or is it now capable of full range of motion?

Yes, I have both Arts & Letters and CorelDraw.  I personally like
Arts & Letters better but there are things I like about Arts & Letters
that CorelDraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  I haven't found the perfect
graphics program that does everything yet.  

My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different
formats.  Arts & Letters does not.  I like the thousands of clipart
available with Arts & Letters.  However, I do find looking them up
in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.

One of my major problems is that there isn't any programs available on
the market for the artistically deprived :-).

I have both!

I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box.

IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk, SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it
has a SCSI hard disk, CD-ROM and tape.

I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier. For the price of one
irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up.

Faster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy

Many state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the
art IDE drives. Only the interface electronis differ - look at the 520MB Fijitsu
drive for an example!

I use an Adaptec 1542B on my Unix box and no-name IDE cards on both.

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does 
not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's
faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain!

A practical suggestion, to be sure, but one could *also* peek into
news.lists, where Brian Reid has posted "USENET Readership report for
Mar 93." Another posting called "USENET READERSHIP SUMMARY REPORT FOR
MAR 93" gives the methodology and caveats of Reid's survey.  (These
postings failed to appear for a while-- I wonder why?-- but they are
now back.)

Reid, alas, gives us no measure of the "power/influence" of readers...

so I've mailed him copies of these reports.

A.  Folks, do we have an FAQ on tinnitus yet?

B.  As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist
who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following
are reasonable conclusions:

1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.
2. The cause it not understood.
3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it.
4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but
there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with
any of these experimental drugs.
5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.
6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes
abates or goes away after a few months.
7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.
8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.
9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on
something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.
10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.
11.  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there
is not.

Well, some form of guaranteed health care isn't a bad idea, but,
yah, I'm a bit worried of a gubnint-run HMO myself.  I'd much

Impressive.

Let the "GREAT CHUCKMEISTER" make a couple predictions, if you
will:

1.  The sun will rise tomorrow.
2.  Rush will bash Clinton on his next show.
3.  I will turn out to be Clinton's love child.

Chances are, I'll get at least one of those right, if I'm lucky.
I may even get two.

No, any first-year PoliSci major will tell you that the Prez

No, he gives the keys to the FBI (who may then give them to the local police
on request) who then simply put some alagator clips on your phone junction
box and conduct an illegal tap. They then decrypt when they recover the tape.
Its just doing what the government does best: breaking the law.

	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.

	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't 
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.

>Isn't that saving money?

	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that
Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an
and have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be
checked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead,
really can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has
responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should
be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist
modes of obfuscationism. 

So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning 
more about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's 
basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see 
who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at 
odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve 
muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles 
of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than 
any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical 
nature.

Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless
you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
escrow houses.  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is
the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about
those two names)

In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this
system.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the
current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody
with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed
as an "oh goody" step upwards.

And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now.

It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's
just an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.  All tapping would need
a warrant, or a breach of security at the escrow houses.

I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in 
Conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional 
names.  Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the
game; IMO it's a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_

Surprise, I agree totally.  The points system is fine, if everybody at all
times has played the same number of games.  Since this is almost never the
case, winning percentage is the way to go.  I don't particularly care if it 
is an "American" thing either, if it works.

I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis
on which to make this argument, but don't you answer your own
question?  Is the reflected signal "shifted" at all from the
act of being reflected?  If so, wouldn't it then be easy for
the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct
sources?

damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year
contract.   THe reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much

Multi year contracts,  that it's now cheaper to just finish them out.

Look at SSF.  THis years funding is 2.2 Billion,  1.8 of which will

These people were very silly.  Any team that gets to the World Series
can win the World Series, and anybody who ever expects a sweep is
crazy.  If you put the best team in baseball in the Series against
the worst team in baseball, the worst team would win at least a game
most of the time and very well could win the Series, though the odds
would certainly be against them.

   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to
   tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good
   slap  round  the  back  of  the  head!),  and  lo'  an'  bloody  behold

   come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a

Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'
                                             op 26 april 1993


In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de
Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar
eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede
universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste
waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde
in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de
voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350
jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.

De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten
sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,
vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala
aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een
planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal
voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies
Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er
staat echter meer op stapel.

Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een
sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het
symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het
huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten
'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.
Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de
deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van
de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de
eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een
beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,
waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een
half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten
zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot
het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op
een apart vel.
Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars
studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN
ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!

Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed
gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht
Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen
het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van
een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,
in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.
Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel
opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en
trachten te verklaren.
Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de
technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn
namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10
miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30
Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal
er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse
technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.

Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en
f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het
verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening
44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de
ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te
worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving
wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na
31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.

Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I,

Be warned, it is not my job to convert you.  That is the job of
the Holy Spirit.  And I, frankly, make a lousy one.  I am only
here to testify.  Your conversion is between you and God.  I am

: -- 

I see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree.

To repent means to turn around.  We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly
arrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to
participate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We
have arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed
us the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other
nations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have
stricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of the
honor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public
as our sins have been.

When Jesus said "Judge not that ye be not judged", he was not addressing
those like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to
repent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down
condemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove
the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  But
He also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a command
too.

Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were
rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the
excuse that we don't want to judge anyone.

In truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more
and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin
what it is and do so openly.  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should.
But instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their
hellward path and onto the heavenward path.

Organization: Physics Department, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands

Dear Mac-friends,

I've seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines
all with 17 Mb RAM installed (70 or 80 ns SIMMs).

If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated
a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated
on the screen.  The lines translate to the top of the screen and
have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they
are a few millimeters apart).
I admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly,
especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark.
Applications which produce this effect are:
- the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2)
- Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU

The machines use their built-in video and drive the old 
Apple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).  
The effect is independent of the settings in the following control 
panels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache) 
        and Monitors (nr of greys/colors).

Have you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ?

Thanks,
Fred

Help!
I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language
characters (in this case Norwegian). I have been manipulating the data
with Excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable
files to an RS6000 workstation.  The Norwegian characters show up fine
under Windows, but appear as "funny" characters on the workstation.  The
workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem
entering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard. 
On further investigation I found that the character codes used by
Windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the
MSDOS code page.  The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as the
workstation.  What gives, and how can get around it.
Please reply by E-mail as I will be out of the office the next few days

A priest I know gave me an interesting explanation.  He said that the
words of Mary point not to doubt or troubled thoughts, but rather to
complete humbleness.  Those who are humble and do not revel in

But the ancient Romans did not observe a seven-day week.  Unless a
man was working for a Jewish employer, he is unlikely to have been
paid on the first day of a seven-day week. Nor would a Jewish
employer have kept his wages over the week-end (see Lev 19:13; Dt

For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between
Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out
that he (Jim) had taken a quote out of context:
>In t.r.m. Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]
>Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really
>busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!

He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of
response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and
Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to
understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't
have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote
out of context.  

I asked Jim the following:
>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for
>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a
>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?

Jim replied by saying 
>Did I either ask or assert that?

But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject
"Silence is concurrence":  

m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes:
>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of
>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual
>may be held responsible for that action?

Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of
context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on
t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.

Does "silence is concurrence" imply that Jim thinks that because I
didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes
out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this
question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.


But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next 
gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he
concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide
the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.
Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help
make it more clear, Jim), titled "Inductive Logic":

>Scenario:
>A white goose waddles past the door

>A white goose waddles past the door

More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large
number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I "axed" his articles,
but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...
Well, I can't see where he is going with this.

But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80
articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with

Yup.

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support
only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for
the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as
the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture
quality if your dithering works right).

I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to
GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.
You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA
card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+
computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a
8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write
some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other
colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg
dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette
the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would
when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but
it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way
gives a brighter more detailed image.

Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as
far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the
VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)

Have a day!

FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license
to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore,
any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent
law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the "average citizen" cannot use
RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.

There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA
encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am
aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.

FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some
guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM.
Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.

I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count
as "mucho bucks" or "incredibly reasonable."  Either way, however, this
definitely falls into the "routines *they* tell you to (use)".

FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under
US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only
impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's
patents.

Organization: Computing Laboratory, U of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK NE17RU
Lines: 89
NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike
in the major version number, is:

  o undo has been implemented.

    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,
    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is
    supported.

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about:

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features, amongst other things,

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xterm-like keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and
Xaw3d options, on the following systems:

   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5
   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5
   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5
   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5
   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5
   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have
only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.

A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been
encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under
R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,
2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only
that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of
aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using
xarchie.

If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word "help" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

All children are born pure, i.e., without sin.
However, most saints would view a pregnancy
outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning.
(Some church members would be much more
judgmental, but that is *their* problem.)

In situations where welfare assistance is 
provided through our Church, bishops usually
require that the family be making some effort to
live the Gospel standards and provide for 
themselves.

However, there are occasions when assistance is
provided because of the children in the home.
As a former bishop of mine said, "Children are 
always worthy before God."

I am not sure what you mean by the term "bastards"
in this context.

Latter-Day Saints believe that through the
temple ordinances the family unit may be
preserved in eternity.

If you use genealogical material or software
produced by the Church, you may notice a section
for "temple ordinances."  Within that section
there should be a spot for signifying "BIC"
which stands for "born in the covenant."

The children born to couple sealed (married)
within the temple are "born in the covenant"
and are eligible to be part of that eternal
family unit.
Children born to other couples (whether in a
civil marriage or not) would have to be
sealed to their parents after their marriage
is solemnized for eternity.

Supposing a child were born to a woman out of
wedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or
her parents at a later date or adopted into 
any eternal family unit (which may include one
of the birth parents).

>"official" position has changed over time, I'm interested in learning both old

I can't say if this principle of adoption
was revealed at the same time as the sealing 
ordinances, but it has been accepted for the 
~15 years I have been in the Church.

I would tend to discount any admonitions from
the Church authorities against having children
out of wedlock because even though there are
provisions within the Lord's plan to recover
what we have done wrong the Church does not
want to give anyone the impression we can sin
and repent at our leisure.

One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him
(seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had
vanished (into the field I guess).

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air, which would short out the terminals.

The same thing happens to my car (Citroen 2CV) -- damp gets under the
bonnet (US: "hood") and shorts the spark-plugs to earth so it won't start.

The solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with
WD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem, then storing the 
battery off the ground may help.  I'm not sure if spraying with WD-40
would be safe since it is very flammable (high percentage petroleum).

Just a thought...

Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that
a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.

I wonder why you say that?  I don't see why having a spouse and/or
kids would have anything to do with it.  It might if you brought
your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get
to bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide
to take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else
be prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later
on, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game.
As it happens, I have a husband but no kids, and my husband usually
attends games with me.

I can see it's a problem if you don't bring your wife to the ballgame,
but that's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1/2 hours.  As far
as bagging work the next day, I don't really understand why that's
necessary, unless going to a game also means that you consume vast
quantities of beer (I note that this is the case for many guys).
If you don't think you can get up to go to work after a long evening
out, then don't have long evenings out during the week.

Look: if I pay between $8.00 and $20.00 apiece for tickets, plus $10.00 
for parking, plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston, 
plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark, then 
I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money.
I can't afford to go to a lot of games.  Hence, going to a game is a
big deal, like going to a play or an opera.  Maybe you have more money than 
I do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you.  
But I'm not interested in having games "sped up", any more than I want to
have _Die Walkure_ cut down to a convenient "weeknight version" of two
hours.  If I felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere 
with my family life or my work life, then I'd choose to go to a weekend game.

Hi folks

I'm planning to buy a LCIII but need advice on choosing a monitor.
What do people recommend for a decent 14"/15" monitor?  

I'v looked at some ads and the spec for NEC 4FG/4FGe and the price is 
within my budget, but could LCIII be able to use the various resolutions 
available on 4FG (specifically the 1024x768 resolution)? Does LCIII only 
support one resolution?

Also any recommendations for a reliable mail order place for LCIII or

I think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
This is a "physical layer" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.
The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
I) physical identification scheme (number).

But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the
manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that.

If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly
changable.  But it is strictly software.

For sale:  Precision drafting machine, Bruning OGP-0180.  Solid
older model with spring-loaded counter balance; clamps on table.  Without
scales.  For right handed person.  $60/make offer, includes UPS/parcel post 
postage.

I'm guessing that it's from the 1940s or 1950s, a period well known for 
excellent drafting machine construction! :-)
It's built with real metal parts, not cheap modern plastic, and it's painted 
the typical office grey popular in that period.  It's smooth working, and 
each of the two "arms" on it measures roughly 24".  It has a dual clamp to 
enable you to clamp it on the edge or corner of a table.

I *did* become a Christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents, and
having studied Buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser
degree.  I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after
having given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not
purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well.
Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the
responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)

It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the
objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic
authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way
of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of
Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter
night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.  I am quite certain that
I was not "brain-washed".

I just installed a MC Power Arc II, and it seems to run great. I also
used MC coils, and neither the ignition module or the coils required
any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC. A little soldering
and all was fine. Static timing was real easy to set too. 

On the other side of the coin, my local wrench, whose opinion I
invariably seek but don't always adopt, thinks MC Power Arc is a "piece
of shit" and says "all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day". 
Needless to say, he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules, and
recommends the Dyna-S system. I think that's the one with the
Hall-effect timing sensor(s), correct?

The 1960's generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible.

The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
kids would not want for anything -- going overboard and creating a nation of
brats.

Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 1969.

Apollo 11 and Woodstock.

Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
reverted to the cultural level of primitives (defecation in public etc.).

And which group assembled, took care of itself, and dispersed with no damage,
no deaths, no large numbers of drug problems ....

A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:

1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation
   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult
   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit
   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,
   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule
   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is
   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.

2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were
   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When
   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault
   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were
   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew
   you could!

3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,
   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and
   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm
   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not
   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up
   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's
   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by
   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I
   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI
   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say
   uncomplimentary.

4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that
   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the
   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing
   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references
   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around
   the "He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!"
   flag.  Sigh.

5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege
   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought
   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button
   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My
   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to
   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to
   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in
   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the
   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In
   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones
   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:
   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and
   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the
   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have
   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it
   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's
   paranoid delusions.

YESSS!  You make me proud to

didn't get shot though. Don't
try that with a good'ole boy in Texas.
I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was 
in my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic
and senseless.  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks
back (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the
freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, "Stick that
finger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your
sorry-ass throat."  I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundred
cars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red
with anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him, 
waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...  I'm glad he decided 
not to shoot me.

We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway.  I finally

reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several
bootable 5-1/4's and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected
the A drive.  I order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and
the number of "stupid" install programs that can't handle an alternate
drive are declining with time - the ones I had are now upgraded.  And
as for the bootable 5-1/4's I just cut 3-1/2 replacements.

If switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis.  I haven't tried it but I think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully.

    A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland
    on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous
    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near
    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part
    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They
    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became
    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle
    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby
    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were
    visible till morning sunrise.

    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in
    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in
    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was
    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.
    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a
    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about
    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the
    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop
    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of
    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright
    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails
    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still
    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.

    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if
    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near
    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969
    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of
    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium
    experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we
    have observed 17 satellite launches.

I happen to take the violation of a person much more seriously than the

This is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong crypto
and are willing to pay the price. After all, one can buy strong crypto today
if one is willing to spend enough.

Thus the concern is not economic.

The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, the
government will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will become
the only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.

As a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
crypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent
that except via Clipper, but "cheap, secure crypto for everyone" is a
political discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of Clipper is 
to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimate
communications and tapping the crooks.

pete zakel is right, we don't need to worry about capitalization
rules. after all, the punctuation gives all the necessary information
about the sentence structure. why should anyone worry about whether the
text is as close to the original as possible. (sarcasm intended).

Then you didn't understand my grumble...  Again, I said to get a
CORRECT version of the Constitution.  The first indicator that
something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern
capitalization rules.  The next thing to go is the spelling, and then
I've even seen versions where the GRAMMAR was modernized (oh, but
don't worry, modernizing the grammar won't change the meaning of the
text, right?... ;-)  [p.s.  I have found about 10 *different* versions
of the Constitution on the network; And accuracy DOES matter...]

It is all written in _The_Wholly_Babble:_the_Users_Guide_to_Invisible_
_Pink_Unicorns_.

To be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns, you must read the Babble,
and obey what is written in it.

To obey what is written in the Babble, you must believe that doing so is
the way to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns.

To believe that obeying what is written in the Babble leads to believing
in invisible pink unicorns, you must, essentially, believe in invisible
pink unicorns.

This bit of circular reasoning begs the question:
What makes obeying different from believing?

If you are planning on using this on a regular basis, conncting the printer
to file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename
that you want to create. I've found that putting a line in system.ini in the
ports section with just a path and filename works. The only problem is that
if you send more than one job, the second one deletes the first.

How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or
burn half your conuntry?  Would you talk nicely?  Would you say please?  You
wouldn't.  The language of the middle east is power and force.  Sorry - that
is the way it is now.  If you aren't strong, you go down.  Israel has to talk

to talk peace.

True - and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort

is also an important factor, wouldn't you say?

What do you want Israel to do?  They are negotating? I'm sick of people calling
for Israel to withdraw from the territories now.  That's not realistic, don't
you realize that?  A solution must be negotiated.  It is on the table.  Have
patience.

That means that it is an effective anti-recidivism measure.  It does
not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime
in the first place.

The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually
stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other
capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death
penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from
committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.

This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent
(short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what
about the case of the innocent executed?

And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the
death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on
the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial
punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the
strongest argument to make.

I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide
for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement
for capital punishment.  Those who don't want to live the rest of
their lives in jail would always have this option.

I don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians
are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and 
muslims are free to so so in other groups as well.

It's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning 
postings. The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups
is the evangelistical method of telling that 'I am right, and you are
wrong'. This is true of both theists and atheists.

Hopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups 
would help concerning assumptions and colorization of views.

Cheers,
Kent

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:
 
Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)
 
I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.
 
My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

chance of having 100 with MIN along with (I would think) easily reaching 100

	Hmmm...Leary is a really good point.  I'd forgotten about him.  Well,
if nothing else, there are plenty of ex-Met pitchers in the category of
"could have lost to all teams" -- Koosman, Leary, Torrez, Ryan, Seaver....
I guess the best three guesses would be Leary, Ryan, and either Seaver or
Koosman.

Two things that annoyed me about the PC Magazine review:

1.  Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown
    by the Graphite and #9GXE's "cheating".  Can't they just admit that
    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach
    is much harder to beat...

2.  The big "cheat" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and
    PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't
    do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing
    PC Magazine says is that scores are not "legitimate" -- couldn't they
    at least make some comment about its real-world performance?

I'm not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve
Gibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx
Draw to benchmark).  If you believe Gibson, that is ... :)  He writes:

    "Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world
     applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than
     any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  Even though it's
     just a modest ISA bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter I
     have, including the Stealth 24 VLB, the Fahrenheit 1280VA/VLB, the
     ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000-based Diamond Viper VLB."

This kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus WinBench
or not!  :)

> When and if you get one send me mail.. I might buy that ATI GU+ off

I already returned the ATI GU+.  My dealer had sold eight of them, and 
seven were returned to him.  I'm now (temporarily) back to running an
original ATI GU, until I get my Graphite.  And, yes, the GU is faster in
my 16 MB system than the GU+, especially in bitmap handling (that's where
you use BitBlits).

Hercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers: you
can buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for 50% off list to try it out.  At
just $199 for Graphite or $249 for the VLB version I decided it was worth
trying (I'm supposed to get the VLB board within two weeks).  I'll post
my impressions when I get it...

i have no experience with State Farm, but i think it's important to
differentiate your experience from a typical "accident."

hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner, and also tends to
be well publicized in the media, so it's to the ins. co.'s benefit
to respond promptly and helpfully.  damage like this doesn't imply
anything about the likelihood of future claims (unless you live in an
area that gets frequent damaging hail storms), so there's no reason
for them to stop covering you.
that's a lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims,
which may be more indicative of claim patterns.

Yeah, I had an XS750 that was the same. The valve seats tend to wear 
very slowly, and anything that might get taken off the pad (which shouldn't
really wear) will tend to compensate - so it's a sort of self-compensating
system.

Pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.  

Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's less
than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain
and reschedule the EVA's in that time.

More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significant
extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are
only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and

I booked a hotel (Red Roof Inn) last week in Cincinnati (Blue Ash, which
is at the northern tip of the metro. Cincy area).  I chose it for a few
reasons.
  1.  All hotels in and near Dayton were booked solid.
  2.  This hotel is only costing $28/night.
  3.  It was one of about 4 rooms left on the night I reserved.
  4.  Cincinnati probably has more to to at night than Dayton.  I intend
      to hit the riverboat entertainment at dusk!

If anyone has other suggestions for nightlife, please let me know of
other hot spots.  Thanks!

  There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I
saw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact with
air.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more
likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to
the tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing
the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane
typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell
leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere,
and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially
semi-rural areas.

  I think it would have disarmed many people if the FBI followed this same
policy.  They have not.  They are making claims without evidence, and what
evidence we have so far tends to refute their story.

Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when
its fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollo
motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few
days.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --
the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.

Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low
altitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational field
is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.

Nope, I haven't seen the film, but Taylor's biography ("The Curve of

What is "doing it right the first time"?  Murdered them all?  Used tanks? 
Maybe they should have had enough evidence to indict.  From the list presented
to date, I haven't seen ANYTHING illegal.  They claim that the BD's bought
components to convert their weapons to Class III devices, but no evidence that
they had done so.  In fact, with a Class III FFL living with them, this may
have been legal (given recent court rulings).

What you really meant to say was that the ATF should have done the right and
lwaful thing.  Or did you just want the BD's dead?

Subject: Gaza and separation from Israel


Gaza and the idea of separation

The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is
presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when
the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We
were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the
Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -
currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous
statement: "You look for me !", i.e., I'am not making any more
efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,
Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew
or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the
Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly
MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from
residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his
government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and
peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether
they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'
perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR
government, regardless of what it does.

These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the
future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to
dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step
towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's
government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a
marginal byproduct of this "government of peace", which need not
disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the "Rabinic"
policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets
and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in
the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.

But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces
itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has
lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian
workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel
Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing
to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the
Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able
to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a
fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.

Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): "...The
liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical
separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to
understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab
workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement
designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that
their ideological support for separation only provides
'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status
quo>.

Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the
ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears
its burden. [.....].

"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,
humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether
this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off
responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to
thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very
easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in
Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at
the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue
all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...".

As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  
late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  
day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  
can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  
application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  
that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  
need to re-boot.

Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  
first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  
GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  
(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  
machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  
the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  
the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  
was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  
board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  
SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  
fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.

The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  
rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  
the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. 

I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  
these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  
day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  
in the sppace of 20 minutes?

What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  
diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  
problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  
Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  
gdi.exe.

Any help is truly appreciated.....

This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:

I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk
at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was
all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy
conclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough
summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as
exactly what he actually said...

Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire
than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not
discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.

Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This
isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has
been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel
hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to
people like Koresh.

Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.
There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.
Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they
called local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for
protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were
changed to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many
small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not
large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of
organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the
FBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they
were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).
"All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that
power."

The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid
illegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners
no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills
disappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its
existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.
Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media
is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a
pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door
and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a
gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't
invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but
if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents
removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in
chains.

The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for
review.

Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and
that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot
at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100
agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had
some medical personnel on hand.

He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest
in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on
the phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and
the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could
be tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns
back.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached
rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.

The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they
audit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his
followers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and
they reacted accordingly.

With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates
was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that
the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their
informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had
more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been
completely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to
knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for
thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,
then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns
down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF
breaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the
Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served
warrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A
close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_
have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was
the first shot fired!

The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial
position on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the
view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held
off a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI
went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was
beginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the
public's sympathy.

Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,
diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents
like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,
well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have
even more tragic results.

PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston
College Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time or
place, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that
information.

It's OK, it's OK... Just a month ago I expressed my belief that the
right to have a means to shoot your neighbor is not that much
necessary to ensure a people's right to be free and got flamed by lots
of American gun supporters. So I thought that...

Never mind. The new Cripple Chip is a purely American problem, so deal

experience of living 30 years under a totalitarian regime (I'm

    He meant the US spends more per capita on guns than Canada which isn't
really surprising because we were so busy protecting the western world from
the USSR that all other countries could slack off on their defense spending.

    I would like to see if the US spends more per capita on people than 
Canada does.  This is a true apples - apples comparison where the previous
post was apples - oranges.

I have heard of two packages for the PC that support X-Win.
The first is Linux which is a free Unix Package.  The Second
is X-Appeal, which sounds pretty good.  It can be found at
 garbo.uwusa.fi in the ~ftp/pc/demo/ dir.  The files are

The "artist renderings" that I've seen of the HST reboost still have
the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree
angle to the Shuttle.  I think the rendering was conceived before the
array replacemnet was approved, so I'm not sure if the current reboost
will occur with the arrays deployed or not.  However, it doesn't 
appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost.

Thanks for the input on GRO's S/A design constraints.  That would 
explain the similar design on UARS.

Heck, the MMS project used to design _missions_ with servicing in mind.
The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement
for the instrument module on EUVE.  That way, you get two instruments
for the price of one spacecraft bus (the Explorer Platform).  A 
second on-orbit replacement was also considered, with the FUSE telescope.

Obviously, most of this is due to the problem encountered while including

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Greetings netters,

Well I have the mother of all locks. On Friday the 16th of April I took
possesion of a 12' Cobra Links lock, 1" diameter. This was a special order.

I weighs a lot. I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder
after about two blocks.

I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD
padlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two
front spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a
post in an underground parking garage.

Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on
me bike.

When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.

By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links
and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of
them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The
guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much
and the inner tubes were free.

Later.

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
of newborn males on the population. Since your friend is not a man, she
can't imagine what it's like to have a penis, much less a foreskin. I
guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male, then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance...

The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be
going to school on a South Pacific island. Tell her to check the Journal
or Urology for circumcision articles. I remember at least 1 on an old
Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean, if the
cancer risk was that great, the Europe who have been circumcising like
crazy, too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a
little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like
mastubation. So you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary.

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in
a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two
home runs).  Or do they?  What is "equivalent average?"

One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took
away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for
doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you
expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, 
hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his
value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.

Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.
I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.
Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.

I'd put him about there too.  

Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he
was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so 
at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't
winning.

Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a
mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)
with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).

We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.
Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;
the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent
the player has left college ball, etc.

Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of "error."  Sometimes
a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.
Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe
McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are
real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)
involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on.

But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.
One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing
ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.

What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a
Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so
on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly?

It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.
(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after
all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.
"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers," they say.  Well,
what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?
It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than
Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in
Atlanta than Greenville.  

Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank
this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's 
worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are 
other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties 
again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.
It's got some error.

Oh well.

Some folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams

the batting order. Until then, I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong,
for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS.

In the majors? I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on "Majors". In the NL,
if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, and
I'd hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because
I've never been able to GET Clark. I'd take any of the three without
hesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).

Williams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn't
headcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops
to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest
Baseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296.
That's not exactly chopped liver.

Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that
continues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently,
some folks would rather be right than be first.

I believe that that would be the same as a system error #64. Since there is no

manager error of "error during font declairation".

I would assume that the system that's on the floppy that you are trying start

My boss is interested in a new 300 series Mercedes Benz wagon.
Does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions
on this car (or line)?

Particularly, I would like to hear about power (manual t. only)
reliability, feel, and any unusually good or bad features of the
line.

She currently drives a VW Passat, and is being plagued by its
electrical problems.  The dealer claims there is nothing wrong,
even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them-
selves while you are driving down the road.  The automatic shoulder
restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along.
She does not have the new, larger engine and is quite
dissatisfied with its lack of power.

The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems
such as the Passat's electrical system.  She is also considering
a Saab 9000 (add some letters).  Any comparisons between the 9000
line and the Mercedes would be helpful.

Price is not an impediment.

For Logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows....
also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse,
both the VGA and SUPERVGA that come with Windows 3.1 will support it. 
both of these are 16 color drivers, if you're lucky the manufacturer of

Yes this is a common problem.  The leaks occur through the seal of the

>2) Where are the drain holes located for the hatch?

There is no drain holes that I know of.  I used a margine tub to drain it
Regretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldn't fix it
under warrantee.  Then I paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system
including a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in 
the trunk.  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would
not retract.  So I ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced; 
$90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket
which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that
when I proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the 
covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.

very annoying.  Don't let the water problem go--get it fixed or you'll pay
more later.  Considering how common a problem it is I hope every one
complains to Ford.

Kent, with regards to the information contained in the Bible (which
is the original context of this thread), Brian Kendig is inside a huge
wall.  Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained therein
are outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the
absurd things he says.  For example, "If I get through into the firey
pit, I will cease to exist."  The Bible doesn't say that.  He hasn't
a clue even to what Jesus said about hell.  That is but one example.

Now in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different
matter.  And to you and to Brian, relativity does play a big role.
What we perceive to be true, depends on our vantage point.  Since I
have read the Bible, and Brian Kendig shows that he hasn't, he has 
a narrower perspective than mine  (at least in the respect
of knowledge of the Bible).   I am proposing to Brian, "Brian, come up here
and take a look from this vantage point."   But Brian replies, "I rather
not thank you.  I am content where I am.  Besides, the vista from up
there stinks."   And in the meanwhile, Brian ignores the facts that
he has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same
plateau where Brian now stands.

IMHO this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough.
 
I do not like a God who prays to Himself.  I refuse to believe Jesus prayed
to Himself  --   let's get real, if the scriptures say He prayed to the
Father, then the Father IS someone different than the Son.  I have no
problems with multiple Gods.  To me, the whole context of the scriptures
says:  Be perfect, even as your Father Who is in Heaven; that we can be
co-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him.
 
Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.
When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God.
 
If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God.
If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God.
 
But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods.
 

[I don't know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself.  The
whole point of the Trinity is that there's enough of a distinction
within God that relationship is possible.  This implies some sort of
communication.  I assume that in their "native" form, the Father and
Son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't
involved.  But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son, i.e.  the Logos
made flesh.  When he's in a human form, his human actions are limited
to human capabilities.  So communication with the Father takes the
form of prayer.  I don't see that there's anything problematical about
that.  It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation.

Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which
is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some
interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.  I
don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to.  I could dig up more
if there is interest.

Yankess (to the tune of "Subterranean Homesick Blues")

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government.
Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off.
Look out kids, it's somethin' you did.
Don't know when, but it's Columbus again.

Mets (to the tune of "Like a Rolling Stone")

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you?
People said "Beware Cone, he's bound to roam"
But you thought they were just kidding you.
You used to laugh about, 
The Strawberry that was headin' out.
But now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud,
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....

Phillies (to the tune of "Highway 61")

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun,
Just keep them off of Highway 61!

Giants (to the tune of "The Ballad of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter")

This is the story of the Magowan,
The man St. Petersburg came to pan,
For something that he never done,
He sits in the owner's box but one...
Day he could have been the Tampian of the world!

I just bought an Altima (and like it very much) and yes there is a

emblazoned in big silver letters, but the itsy-bitsy Stanza is shunted
to the far left of the trunk lid. You can only see it if you get up
close to the car and know where to look. It is very inconspicuous.

In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual
called the car a Nissan Stanza Altima.

Sounds like you were going to a different Penn State or something.
Kampus Krusade for Khrist is very vocal here, but they really have
little power to get anything done.  Sometimes it seems like there
are a lot of them because they're generally more vocal than their
opposition, but there really aren't that many Krusaders.

The liberals tend to keep to themselves if they can help it, since
all they really want is to be allowed to go about their own lives
the way they want to.  ...so you don't hear from or about most of
them.  The bible-bangers stand out because they want everyone to
be forced to live according to bible-banger rules.

The Krusaders certainly don't run this place.

I'd say we've got a rather average mix. of people here....
much like the rest of the U.S.  And just like everywhere else,
some factions are louder than others.

No, the Grand canyon is not too far away.  Short side trips to Kolob
(between Cedar City and Hurricane) and Pipe Springs (on the way from
Hurricane to the Grand Canyon) may be interesting--they are right
off the highway.  Pipe Springs (a small fort) gives you real insight
into just how the pioneers lived.  You have missed one major must
see attraction--Cedar Breaks in the mountains above cedar city.
Take lots of film--they have a reason for calling this kodachrome
country.  Natural Bridges in the four corners area is also very
scenic, but may be too far off your route.  Monument valley is
spectacular, but again may be too far away.

  Ah, so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance
other than scrutinizing "Sorority Babes in Heat". Congrats!

  Trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you
converted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the
difference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for
a laserdisc company or something).

  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at 
the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could
hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes
contact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch. 

  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) 

  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but
I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips. 

>Gary's list of "I'd give Dave Kirsch's kidneys to have a swing like that."

  Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. 

  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean
Palmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz's swing. 

>That's all for now.  I'm looking at Derrick May's tapes tonight, along

  A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball.
IMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders
low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
and left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
the right side of the infield in the next month.

Any comments on the absorbtion of the Office of Exploration into the
Office of Space Sciences and the reassignment of Griffin to the "Chief
Engineer" position?  Is this just a meaningless administrative
shuffle, or does this bode ill for SEI?

In my opinion, this seems like a Bad Thing, at least on the surface.
Griffin seemed to be someone who was actually interested in getting
things done, and who was willing to look an innovative approaches to
getting things done faster, better, and cheaper.  It's unclear to me
whether he will be able to do this at his new position.

Does anyone know what his new duties will be?

Sorry!

What does the Coptic Church believe about the will and energy of Christ?
 Were there one or were there two (i.e. Human and Divine) wills and
energies in Him.

Also, what is the objection ot the Copts with the Pope of Rome (i.e. why

FAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette

This is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are
mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.
We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.
Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu 
as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography 
FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers 
every 21 days.


Contents:

* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?
* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?
* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?


* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?

  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always
  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.
  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same
  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the
  readers want to see.

* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?

  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were
  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be
  patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many
  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,
  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of
  people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your
  postings in the right group.

  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic
  ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.

* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?

  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some
  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a
  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.

  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some
  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by
  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the
  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is
  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some
  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts
  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but
  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most
  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.

  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,
  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and
  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the
  introductory textbooks.

  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at
  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens
  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily
  answered on your own.

  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some
  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your
  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to
  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated
  in some areas.)

  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.
  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted
  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break
  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough

  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA

Yes, long before Star Trek.  Before Einstein, in fact.

Vulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation
of Mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets.  But
Einstein's theory of relativity explained Mercury's motion, and analysis
of Mercury's motion now shows there are _not_ any planets inside its orbit.

Oh, you foolish person.  I do know what the fuck I'm talking about
and will gladly demonstrate for such ignorants as yourself if you

The legalization of drugs will provide few if any of the benefits
so highly taunted by its proponents:  safer, cheaper drugs along
with revenues from taxes on those drugs; reduced crime and reduced
organized crime specifically; etc, etc

If you would like to prove how clueless you are, we can get into
why - again a lot of wasted posts that I don't think this group
was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little
research.

I really disagree with you. But maybe you know better. Here is the 
issue at hand:


     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'
      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), 
          "The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi", p. 213.)


 "The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination 
  of the Muslim population in Soviet Republic of Armenia, Karabag, 
  Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the 
  extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government 
  during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII."
                  (Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25, 1992)
                 

 "Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against
  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Republic
  of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan,
  are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide 
  perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the
  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these
  lands."         (Cebbar Leygara - Kurdish Leader - October 13, 1992)

I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old.
Some screens went completely (as above), others were just "dodgy".

This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up
to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the
company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just
unlucky!

Wrong, wrong, completely wrong (and a little misleading, too).

White noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a
constant bandwidth. That is, a 5 Hz wide band at 20 Hz will have precisely
the same amount of energy as a 5 Hz band at 20 kHz.

Pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant
precentage bandwidth. Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whose
bandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20
kHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). 

White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant
bandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose
bandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as "1/3
octave" or "1/2 octave" or some such terminology).

White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies
(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,
has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3
db/octave).

Is there a hot-key for the Windows 3.1 screen saver utility?  If not, is
there an easy way to create one?  The reason that I need one is that my
dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the
information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away
from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly
secure).  Also, the system manager won't let any software be added so 
another program such as LOCK32.ZIP from cica or a different screen saver
is out.

Thanks for any and all help.

MASSACRE UNCOVERED....

By ANATOL LIEVEN,

More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have 
been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims 
that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.

Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley 
and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's 
massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.

From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of 
Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters 
of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their 
own lines.

We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last 
troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out. 
They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov, 
who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert 
to ease their departure.

A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their 
dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the 
same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian 
positions.

In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another 
31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures 
do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed 
the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also 
do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies

Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200 
people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came 
by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and 
of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies 
we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. 
The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which
killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. 
All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly 
clothing of workers.

Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national 
volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians, 
including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS, 
APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED 
IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.

SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD 
INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY 
SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

  To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has
brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that
were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don't
think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.
McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the
bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young
Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is
the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.

Hi,

I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this
LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.
My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882
on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,
the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but
I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when
it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have
any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance.

     Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of
my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind
of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as
it normally would a "foreign" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the
body evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells
apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she
successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active
9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.

the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know
whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive
pregnancies.
     Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this?

On the other side of the fence, I owned a Bieffe off-road helmet.
Took what I would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage
to the shell.  Yes, the helmet did its job.  But the damage/impact
ratio was scary.  I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX),
and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons.  My
recommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear.  YMMV.

I don't know if this is still true, but at one time Coca-Cola
took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  For instance,
several plants in different cities each made one of six partial
concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed
in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole
formula.  By now, I would guess that PepsiCo's chemists would have
reverse-engineered it; can't be all that exotic.  Actually I
prefer Pepsi anyhow; in about 3 minutes I'm gonna put money

   It's not Clipper, it's any encryption system.  I've seen a number of
   designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.

Depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same
key, it can be done.  For example, I was using "vat", which is an
Internet Audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the
session.  (Unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't
have the CPU for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different
site)

So, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge.  But if
you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the
conversation....

Hear, hear!  Thanks, Robbie.

You also don't read that much about violence *against* teenagers, such as
George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17-year-olds,
who were trying to surrender, with bulldozers.


On the other hand, I think it *is* true, without singling out teenagers
for blame, that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be.
Those of us who'd like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
with people of all ages.

[PTS]       The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective
[PTS]       --------------------------------------------------------
[PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade
[PTS] 
[PTS] 

[AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh
[AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western
[AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established
[AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have
[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me
[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the
[AR] origins of the conflict.

During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,
a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.

The following should be interesting. 

[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and
[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,
[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian
[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,
[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,
[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait
[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.

This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an
independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September
1991, page 28, we read:

 "By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in
  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party
  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to
  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were
  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 
  Armenian inhabitants fled the city..."

  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in
  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away."

In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian 
pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!

[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that
[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule
[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of "divide and
[AR] rule."  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year
[AR] history of the conflict.

It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the
perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.
 
[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in
[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an
[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in
[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian
[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.

Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an
agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-
Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.
 
[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri
[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and
[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the
[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly
[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly
[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.
 
It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the 
Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian
culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The
Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and
play dead. 

[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country
[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the
[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish
[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government
[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and
[AR] possessions?

The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they
attempted to deprive Armenians of "lands, homes, and possessions".
 
[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.
[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian
[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,
[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.

True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!
 
[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.
[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western
[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security
[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led
[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed
[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the
[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.
[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.

Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into
this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of 
Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!
Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would
have us believe.
 
[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an
[AR]"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan."  The truth is that the Armenians
[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.

Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish
claim. 

Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as "Artsakh", which 
comes from the Urartian term "Urtekhe-Urtekhini". NO Azeris yet! 

Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as "Orkhistena". NO Azeris yet!

In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid
Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!

From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom
of Ervan. NO Azeris yet!

Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or 
Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 
A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the 
Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!

By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!

Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen "To
Armenia". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!

In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area
was stated as 11,000.

It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central
Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence
in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!

In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some 
Muslims in Karabakh!

In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188
priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian
percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --
assuming no Kurds!

Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:

 "The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the
  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings
  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and
  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis
  Republic.

  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!

				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan
							N. Narimanov

				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs
							Guseinov"

[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their
[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian
[AR] rule. 

No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule
in the Caucasus, including Karabakh!

[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew
[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How
[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in
[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and
[AR] demanded separation from California?

Non-sequitur. 
 
[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement
[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.

Armenian historians don't say this!

[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the
[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and
[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.

Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and
their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an 
argument totally invalid!

[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to
[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,
[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.

Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-
political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,
Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their
minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other
nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.

[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the
[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the
[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual
[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This
[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the
[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory
[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.

Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of
Armenians.
 
[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the
[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the
[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the
[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.

Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian
enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory
is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local
population! 
 
[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should
[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as
[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the
[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can
[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri
[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.
 
Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their
own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are 
actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war
in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as
an act of Allied aggression!

That figure (1/4") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are
adjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central USA distribution point
(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor
(the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my
case quite :).

>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?

I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was "normal"). The short answer is no, don't accept these
"imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and
if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

No, but...

You can allocate real static data within code segments!
When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap.

You can forget most of what was written about memory management. Under 3.1
you have paged virtual memory. You can lock every block without hampering
the memory manager. You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock/
Unlocking the memory block.

An besides: DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's, that happen to be called
by another task.

Of course I became a resident, and could drive on my US license until

Let me improve this one for you, then. For nearly one thousand years, 
the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last 
one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The 
persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and 
carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. 
After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks
and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands,
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned 
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...

- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render 
reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its 
rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary.

- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement 
protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued 
coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet
Armenia.

- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

"Your three chiefs, Dro, Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian are the ringleaders
 of the bands which have destroyed Tartar villages and have staged 
 massacres in Zangezour, Surmali, Etchmiadzin, and Zangibasar. This is
 intolerable. Look - and here he pointed to a file of official documents
 on the table - look at this, here in December are the reports of the last
 few months concerning ruined Tartar villages which my representative
 Wardrop has sent me. The official Tartar communique speaks of the
 destruction of 300 villages."

p. 54 (fifth paragraph).

"Yes, of course. I repeat, until this massacre of the Tartars is stopped
 and the three chiefs are not removed from your military leadership I
 hardly think we can supply you arms and ammunition."

"...it is the armed bands led by Dro, Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian who
 during the past months have raided and destroyed many Tartar villages in
 the regions of Surmali, Etchmiadzin, Zangezour, and Zangibasar. There are
 official charges of massacres."

I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),
and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.

How about measuring vertical distance as well, any chance - or am I getting
ridiculous?

What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

%By Elias Davidsson - April 1991 (Revision Oct. 1991)

Note - you are already posting "facts", some of which are outdated.

The biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that
you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful
exchange that might lead to a "meeting of the minds".  It is to those
who read with open mind, that I address myself.

%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the
%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member
%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial
%discrimination as "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or
%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic
%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing
%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of
%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,
%social, cultural or any other field of public life."

While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,
as the text currently stands I know of no country in which
racial discrimination of some sort can not be found.
It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative
violation.

%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining
%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The
%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since
%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli
%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of
%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United
%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial
%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.

If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative
statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be
applied to any other case where the council perceives some form
of racial discrimination as previously exhibited.

Scarey thought.

%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of
%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native
%non-Jews born in that country. 

Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not
alienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be
correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes
apparent.  This slant permeates the text.

%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas
%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most
%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the
%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.

The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting
Beduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.
Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the
issue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].

%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim
%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant
%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).

If I recall correctly, at the time "zionism" took off, there
was no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any
factual contradictory evidence .

%But the
%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and
%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the
%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native
%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and
%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could
%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000
%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.

Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on "most
of their villages"?

%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to
%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their
%political repression and their destitution.

There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later
used for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the
intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was
that this was not the case.

You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded
this.  As you do again, below.

%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied
%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus
%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its
%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered
%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security
%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and
%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these
%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.

Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,
though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.
Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other
annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.

%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,
%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of
%international law and UN resolutions.

Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,
what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories
captured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country
previously (other than Iraq) ?

%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under
%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as
%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a
%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).

Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against
on an "ethnic or racial" basis.  Therefore your above statement is
incorrect.

I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,
the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.
However, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist
at the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not
argue racial discrimination during that period!

%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a
%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that
%represents them in world affairs.

Once again, some do, some don't.

%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab
%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant
%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.

Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care
about anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you
espouse.

%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the
%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject
%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be
%challenged in court.

Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.
Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all
of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some
are, but this is not due to the "whims" of the military as
much as the sizeof the task/organization.

%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied
%territories are permitted to carry firearms.

Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in
Daheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of
the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.

%Jewish settlers have
%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents
%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel
%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in
%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will
%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates
%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish
%settlement.

That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your
purpose is/was in posting this.

%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them
%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For
%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected
%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by
%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish
%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and
%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to
%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in
%practice.

Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,
right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way
you seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but
as a result of what actions?

%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the
%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are
%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on
%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these
%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied
%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in
%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews
%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government
%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of
%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;
%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their
%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and
%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian
%children are denied the right to learn their history and
%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end
%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the
%authorities.

1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.
    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no
    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish
    collective.

2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind
    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has
    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large
    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case 
    in point.

3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation
    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously
    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.
    It is based upon Jordan's school system.

4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another
    gross generalization.  

%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of
%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never
%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the
%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its
%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards
%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is
%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs
%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately
%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen
%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of 
%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme
%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in
%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the
%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.

Another generalization, but lets not stop here.
The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,
Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the
territories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,
I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered
previously.

%Although sexual
%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,
%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal
%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system
%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.

When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,
nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious
intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and
the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.

%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on
%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has
%not produced any written Constitution. 

Simply incorrect.
The answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the
dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your
contentions to the sidelines.

%Zionism predicates a state
%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,
%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak
%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli
%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be
%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial
%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only
%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the
%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.

But the discrimination is not based upon race.
Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.

%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that
%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -
%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed
%to fail.

Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.
Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as
you are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate
shall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the
amount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00.

magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a
video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions

If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and

Obviously, it is ultimately the teams choice...the NHL would obviously

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume

lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want to

Yes, so? How do we know they *weren't* very good? (Again, assuming that the
Quran is beautfully written.)

I haven't interviewed all muslims about this; I would really like it if this
were false. But I can't take it on your say-so - what are your sources?

What other basis do we have to judge a system? Especially when we can't get
a consistent picture of what Islam "really" is. Do I believe Khomeini? Do I
go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca? Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey? Or
perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran. Ok, whose translation? And
what about things like "And wherever you find idolators, kill them"?

Hey, sounds great. Does that mean that W4WG works with ODI? I thought it   
uses NDIS.                                                                 
                                                                           
My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my   
UMBs, so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make W4WG work      
along.                                                                      
                                                                            
I read in a German computer magazine that TCP/IP support for W4WG is just   
around the corner. Anybody have any news about this?

Probably she meant that your blood pressure went up while you were on

what she meant, since no one else can answer for another person.

I don't know why it is so obvious.  We are not speaking of acts of the 
flesh.  We are just speaking of emotions.  Emotions are not of themselves
moral or immoral, good or bad.  Emotions just are.  The first step is
not to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that
we hide our true feelings, it is to accept ourselves as we are, as God
accepts us.  It seems that Paul's anger he has accepted and channeled
it to a plea to all of us to refrain from passing judgement on those
afflicted with a disease and to reach out to others.  Give in?  Calling
his arguments foolish, belittling them to only quarrels, avoiding action
because of fear to give others a bad feeling, he's not forgiving?

Re-think it, Aaron.  Don't be quick to judge.  He has forgiven those with
AIDS, he has dealt with and taken responsibility for his feelings and made
appropriate choices for action on such feelings.  He has not given in to
his anger.

OK...

5) How about a fuel gauge that *really* told you how much fuel was
   left.  Like, "can I make it to where the gas is $1.14 or should
   I get gouged right here at $1.35?"  Accurate to the tenth of a
   gallon would be great.

	Hi everyone,
	I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming 
in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep 
getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the 
program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so 
I can't seem to explain why it crashes.

All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and
after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads
me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.  

Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions
that do not return anything??

	I have been working on this problem for days and I would really
appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup, I will
gladly re-post, but this is the only I could find.

Thanks in advance,

Ravi,

	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  
vertical position.  If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position, it can  
not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.   
I'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but  
why take that chance?  If you want more detailed info on the problem, please

UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES

    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
    would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design
    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.


    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into
    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20
    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas
    scintillation proportional counters.


    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint
    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.
    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA
    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon
    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the
    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,
    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's
    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.

    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.

    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the
    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of
    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan
    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan
    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true
    nature of Saturn's rings.

    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned
    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to
    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have
    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data
    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from
    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve
    approximately 70% of its original objectives.

    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made
    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,
    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon.


    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire
    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity
    map.


    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.
    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in
    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for
    one martian year (687 days).


    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched
    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the
    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global
    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially
    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also
    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.


    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over
    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields
    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for
    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.

    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of
    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from
    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist
    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole
    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its
    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft
    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!

    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and
    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see
    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical
    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.


    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron
    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro
    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based
    on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.

    1993 Missions
	o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]
	    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform
	    a wide-field sky survey in the "soft" (low-energy) X-ray
	    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search
	    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white
	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also
	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron
	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos
	    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development
	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the
	    technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch
	    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.

	o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]
	    Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.

	o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01]
	    Gather radar images of Earth's surface.

	o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket]
	    Study of Stratospheric ozone.

	o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS]
	    Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be
	    recovered after it conducts the various scientific and
	    engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and
	    retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.

    1994
	o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket]
	    June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the
	    Earth.

	o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02]
	    International Microgravity Laboratory.

	o ADEOS [NASDA]
	    Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.

	o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS]
	    Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure
	    and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.

    1995
	LUNAR-A [ISAS]
	    Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the
	    moon's interior.


    Proposed Missions:
	o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)
	    Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space
	    observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for
	    15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.

	o Earth Observing System (EOS)
	    Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to
	    provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science
	    including planetary evolution.

	o Mercury Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch.

	o Lunar Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar
	    orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would
	    survey characteristics to provide a global context for the
	    results from the Apollo program.

	o Space Infrared Telescope Facility
	    Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of
	    the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with
	    a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and
	    other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic

Always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings
is not problematic.

But, as you put, Being the source of "all" existence, including one's own,
would mean that God came from nothing, a concept alien to Christianity and
Theism.  It is better to understand the classical concepts of Necessary and
Contingent existence.  God exists necessarily, always.  God created
contingent beings.  This is a coherent solution to existence, so long as
the concept of God is coherent.

Not a very good answer.  If reason cannot by any means understand something
then it is likely that "it" is a null concept, something not in reality.

	I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think
you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM
+/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common
I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940.
I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of
difference.

	Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote,
and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very
detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the
transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding
specs. if the system uses that.

I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a
definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly
and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition
is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids
mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous
work.  Lee Lady writes:

Unless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as a
mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would
consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as
unscientific.

Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not
clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be
taken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider,
for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking
a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and
what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what
invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and
still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,
that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that
some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are
ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the
definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are
"mainly about."

The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient
context for people to understand my proposed definition.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only
take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians
that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  

As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about
"absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talk
about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the
kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have
proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of
degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the
relevance of different kinds of evidence.  

One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as
psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion
regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,
the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the
historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence
are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to
speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that
speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to
identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence
was presently available for them, and to describe how research
could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to
uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper
of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the
author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It
is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --
deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When
proponents of some practice see no value in more careful
investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many
researchers' minds.  

This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some
intersection between things that are worth investigating and
things that are advocated by those who seem careless or
unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can
understand why many scientists would just as soon select other
directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one
wants to become this generation's Rhine.

I think this is absurd.

I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,
dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are
submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for
publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly
eases one's defense.)

Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either
on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little
about either and so have nothing to offer.

I answer in the affirmative.  Now this answer might sound a little

Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says 
he will need to be proven wrong about it.  Well, I don't even waste 
my time trying.  I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it. 
In response, he tells me he will say an "atheist's prayer" for me. 

Good luck, Bob.  And, best regards.

	I got a few requests asking for a summary, so I'll attempt one
here:


	Here's the ones I know of:

	Wind/U		- Bristol Technologies

	Hunter SDK	- Hunter Systems

	MainWin		- MainSoft

	LIBWXM          - Visual Solutions


	Hunter 

	The company is going through some big changes.  I expect
to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name.  At the moment, it
is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info.
Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. 

	Visual Solutions

	LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about.  They don't
yet support MDI or MFC.  Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical
modeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol.
Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  She's very helpful.

	MainSoft

	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that
can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at
runtime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go
straight to Xlib.  They don't yet support MFC.  They're at 415 896 0708.

	Bristol

	This company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses
Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work
in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon.
My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example
program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles.
They're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.

Earlier today I read an ad for REAL-3D animation & ray-tracing software and
it looked very convincing to me. However, I don't own an Amiga and so I began 
to wonder, if there's a PC version of it.

So, has anyone seen/used REAl-3D for DOS??

You obviously did not watch the Twins in Chicago.

No cold spell?  It's been snowing most of the week in Minnesota.

gee.... is it 1999 already?

Yes, it will still be on the fox program chasis, anything that will be different
on the new car as far as mechanical's is unknown. The suspension will most
likely be changed, as well as the drive drain. From what has been printed on
it, there is no clear idea of what will be done, as some say it will have
the modular V8 and others the current small block... just have to wait and see
Also is far as styling goes from what I seen is good, a return to tradition.
C scoop on the sides and roof line much like a '65 or '66 fastback.

Nope, Germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws.  The 
ethnic Germans who have lived in Russia for over 100 years 
automatically become citizens if they move to Germany, but the
Turks who are now in their third generation in Germany can't.
It's not a very good example to show citizenship without descent.

backdesk.zip is on CICA, but I'm not sure of the whole directory.

Another to throw into the running is topdesk.  It is alsow on CICA, but
I'm not sure where.  It is more complicated then backdesk, but I've found
it to be more stable and more usefull.  I recomend it to people who

You want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were
maimed or killed by bombing at the end of WW2, when it was far from clear

Fine.  Write to your Congressman and to President Clinton.  China's status as
"Most Favoured Nation" comes up for renewal in June.  Point out that the US
shouldn't be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime.

I doubt anything will happen.  Clinton's keener on trade sanctions against
Europe.

The same tired old misunderstanding.  Moral relativism means that there is no
*objective* standard of morality.  It doesn't mean you can't judge other
people's morals.  Christ on a bike, how many times have we tried to hammer

Obviously not, as I am an atheist.  I don't think you'd get on with Jesus,

Right.  Unfortunately for you, it turned out that my opinions on the matter
were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too.

I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing
policy, too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets
and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I
understand it, that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian
targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the
German people.

Oh, come on.  With wars like the Falklands fresh in people's minds, that sort

Yes?  And what about the millions of casualties the Russians suffered?  It's

Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey's

Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  Is it okay for a
remanufacturer to resell only ROM chips from used machines?  I know that
copies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to
resell the original used ROM.  (After all, reselling a used computer
involves the sale of the ROM anyway, so what's the difference?).

Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would
be a reasonably price to offer?

No wonder you 'wieneramus' are in such a mess. Following the Greek 
Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek 
army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international 
agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten 
people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose 
grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. And the next is
'Karabag'.

The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek 
Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will 
remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever 
the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece 
was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent
its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate
government of Archibishop Makarios.

The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of
course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct.

             THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM

2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus

It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at
the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched
against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat
Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally
killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage
Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the
24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities
committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum.

AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY
GREEK TERRORISTS

The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the
Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been
going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men
and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal
Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage
bloodshed...

The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a
major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,
are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the
bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their
home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.

Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by
Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded
during the same terrible event.

"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan
and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.
Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.
Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting
having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River
direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.
Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was
dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought
would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in
the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We
waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing
in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her
arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.
Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house
with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard
voices saying, in  Greek, "You want Taksim eh!"  and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children
fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,
who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I
heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.

When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the
neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what
had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to
the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was
brutally murdered.

In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying
"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?"  I became terrified. I
thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not
dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself
under the double-bed.

An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My
mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some
water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the
bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I
offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who
were all wounded.

We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I
thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed
to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber
and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked
as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.

There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were
operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there
were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.
Ayshe and her daughter.

After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to
Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months
treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,
Greeks arrested me at the Airport.

All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my
detention. They then released me."

ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER

We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in
which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five
days.

We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some
terrible sights.

In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way
into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A
child's bicycle lay in a corner.

In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother.

In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the
head.

This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.

Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the "DAILY EXPRESS")

"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant
children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."

                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks 
                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Subject: 3rd CFV and VOTE ACK: comp.os.os2.{programmer.porting,setup,multimedia,bugs}
Organization: University of Texas at San Antonio
Lines: 476

* Attention voters:
*
* I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting.
* Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV.
* If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again.
* (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)


Introduction:

	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation
	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)
	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)
	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)
	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)
	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)

	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer
	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).
	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
	comp.os.os2.bugs.

	This document contains:
	*  the background showing the need for these proposals
	*  the proposed charters for these proposals
	*  voting instructions
	*  a voting ballot
	*  some example ballots
	*  the voting rules
	*  the voting schedule
	*  the Mass Acknowledgement


Background:

	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2
	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such
	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,
	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.

	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and
	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the
	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility
	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
	procedures, etc.

	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows
	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).

	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,
	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.
	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
	comp.os.os2.misc for details).


Proposed Charters:

	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
		spur additional development.  The group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,
		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program
		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and
		so forth.

	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.

	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the
		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
		performance optimization.

	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.

	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug
		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in
		comp.os.os2.beta]

        e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24

----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------


Example Ballot #1:

	(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes
	(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes
	(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no

	(f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John

	In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of
	comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view
	on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. 


Example Ballot #2:

	(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes
	(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes
	(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes
	(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes
	(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes

	(f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane

	In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all
	the proposals.


Voting Rules:

	* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most
	  recent vote will be counted.

	* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,
	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.

	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings
	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.

	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will
	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).

	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is
	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.

	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal
	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:
	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes
	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).
	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the
	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).
	  In other words, a proposal passes if:
	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)
	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.


Schedule:

	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted
	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).

	This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the
	Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who
	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you
	have not voted yet, vote now!

	The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on
	April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.
	The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
	date.


Mass Acknowledgement:

Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with
molded plastic teeth? I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and
it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing
it (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after
spreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not
the usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so
they were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the
adjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right
amount of Zipper Squish (TM).

I've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the
Accessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of
charge. I don't know what brand of zippers HG uses, but parts ARE
available for YKK's plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple, just
break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps
the pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then
crimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop.

You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement
parts.

Oh, for what it's worth, the coil-type zippers on the Eclipse tankbag
are also YKK.

I just got a K75 and had the heated grips installed.  As far as I can
tell the grips look and feel the same as the standard grips. 
They are *not* soft.  Last weekend I did a 500 mile round-trip and
got to a point where it was in the 30s and raining.  Those heated

When Robert refers to the "orthodox", he is talking about the Historical
position of the Christian Faith. Such things are derived from Biblcal
texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.

You are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this
is alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes
to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs,
there is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the
doctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the
texts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be.
According to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.

Therefore, when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and
thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the
Bible, people consider him a cult.

Agreed!  I own a Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with the V6 and
the AT.  In the past, I've been biased towards manual/standard transmissions(I owned
an Aerostar with a 5-speed, it was awesome!), but settled with the AT in the

Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the
following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified
explanation.

Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer
adapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that
"Something's happening here, please take note." How the CPU is
programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.
In MS-DOS, the "interrupt vector" is used to store the address of the
function that handles each interrupt.

Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready
to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When
DOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,
wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to
the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's
free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. 

With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing
approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU
cycles.) Hence, you can't "share" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're
running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.

Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses
interrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what
to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is
required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is
needed.

You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use
them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine
is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came
from. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.

Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the
general picture correctly enough.

Cheers,

Well, Michael,  I don't know if clh has left them in the faq  (Maybe you should
post the "how to get there map again), but I posted two or three lengthy
exegetical paper on these verses.  They looked at the OT, NT and
intertestimental usages of terms in reference.  I would suggest you read those
before you talk about a "need" in exegetical studies.  If those aren't enough,
I could also provide "The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai".  Dr James
DeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of '92.  To read
any of these 4 papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need
for honest exegesis.

Again, please refer to the faq file, or if you are unable to acess it, drop me
a line and I will enclose them to you.

Hell, just save your candle stubs and bring them.  Light them up, and
dribble the wax all over the kindling wood and light _that_.  Although

Hopefully, a miracle (o.k. not quite a miracle, but close!) will occur and
Pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals.  If they make it again, 
they will probably keep the Cup.  If they don't, it's the Hawks' turn!

I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.

In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.
Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_

THERAPY INEFFECTIVE

Recently the founders of yet another prominent "ex-gay" ministry, Exodus
International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.
Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers
for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The
program was described by these men as "ineffective . . . not one person was
healed."  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent
feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were
driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed "reparative therapy."

The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June
30, 1992 called "The Ex-Ex-Gay" by Robert Pela.

Some personal thoughts:

It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major
portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among
its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all
they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to
save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even
later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and
segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.
Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is
still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind
control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than
God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt
thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is "physically" forced
to stay in this "reparative therapy" but sheer social pressure is enough for
many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.

As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution
against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by
the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,
not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t
a clue what is in their heart.

For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them
please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians
And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of
people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends
who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to
a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some "first-hand" real life and
loving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no
less abundant.

Thank you.

Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business
or professional body in a position to establish a standard and
provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission
systems.

RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of
a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.

Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they
all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.

If we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to
put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a
crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to
implement it, we might avoid government control.

Otherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably
strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They
are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through
the Clipper Chip.

Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,
would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.

If not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented
in either SW or HW and publish it, then push to make it the defacto
standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such.

We are opposing, charging the bunker.  We should be nimble and clever.
The gov is strong, not clever.

It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever
administration is current for things they couldn't possibly have
initiated.  This chip had to take *years* to develop, yet already
we're claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us.
Bullshit.  The *Bush* administration and the career Gestapo were
responsible for this horror, and the careerists presented it to the
new presidency as a fait accompli.  That doesn't excuse Clinton and
Gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it, but let's lay

An universe it has created. By the way, can you tell me why it is less
tyrannic to let one of one's own creatures do what it likes to others?
By your definitions, your god has created Satan with full knowledge what
would happen - including every choice of Satan.
 
Can you explain us what Free Will is, and how it goes along with omniscience?
Didn't your god know everything that would happen even before it created the
world? Why is it concerned about being a tyrant when noone would care if
everything was fine for them? That the whole idea comes from the possibility
to abuse power, something your god introduced according to your description?
 
 
By the way, are you sure that you have read the FAQ? Especially the part

Fedorov, Primeau, Kozlov, Lidstrom, Sillinger, Konstantinov, Drake,

Devellano...Murray inherited these guys...in addition to Yzerman,

No...Quinn had far less...Murray took over Detroit at a time to

I read the article as presenting first an argument about weapons of mass
destruction (as commonly understood) and then switching to other topics.
The first point evidently was to show that not all weapons should be
allowed, and then the later analysis was, given this understanding, to
consider another class.

Very well put.  And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian
brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at 
all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  Should Christians 
just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  By 
reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are 
they using "a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus"? 

Frankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to 
pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other 
Christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than 
people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.

I recently got a Centris 610 4/230 on my desk. It's a vast improvement on
my previous machine (a IIsi 5/40). However .....

I've encountered a problem with fonts ..

Entries in a Filemaker 2.0 database which looked fine when printed from my
previous mac using System 7.01 now look wierd !

Spacing between characters has increased greatly - causing lines to be
truncated. I'm using plain and bold Helvetica in various sizes - the
increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles. 

I'm using a mixture of TrueType and Fixed-Size fonts - exactly as on my
IIsi - when things worked perfectly.

We've managed to get similar behaviour using Word 5.1.

Apple UK adopted their usual "friendly" approach and told us to call our
local dealer - God help us !!

Any ideas ??

There might be an IPAS routine that does that,but I can'r be sure.  Another
way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
image.  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection.  It will
take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection, but that's
the only thing I can think of.

>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
>what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.

It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is
usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car
with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a
poorer Cd. 

To calculate drag use this formula:

D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S

Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),
V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the
pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure
(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). 

Note that power is:

P = F * v

Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v
is velocity (ft/s). 

Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for
force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power
result in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. 

So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top
speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)

101 mph

Sorry to dissappoint.

The Chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the
Buick Co. when Durant was there.

When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and
others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful
Chevrolet company.

A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM!
That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company
Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!

After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM
board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given
the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure.
(If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy
division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the "passenger
car division" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)

I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased
the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  The second time,
after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing
list (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and
made it *much* better.  However it now makes a "scritch scritch" noise on rough
roads, and *still* squeals when I open/close the window in wet weather (anyone
elses's do this?)

>>Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!

I got two keys with my car, but only ONE remote-entry push-button thingie!
But then, I bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and  I think it may have been a
repossession ... so I'm not surprised something was missing :-(

I am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where

about notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford.  Those little
"you've-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep" buttons are

Well, I guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  When someone
hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car.  They may
not associate the sound with a small "jap car" style car (like the Probe is).

>>Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 
>Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.

The mudflaps help a lot.

>>transmission (the 5 speed is a must)

I have always been a 5-speed guy.  Almost every car I've ever owned has been
a 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I
(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty
high-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with
torque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the
highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I 
probably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been
around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the
"control" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out
to be very convenient.  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and
drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in 
"we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts" :-)


>>No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)

Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  I've gotten them to fix the
worst of them, but I fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will
be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.

>>Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

On my 89 Probe GL, I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears,
and had driven the replacement tires (Bridgestone) 50K miles when
I tradeed the car.  The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe
look like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow
tread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  But the car handles
very very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough
surface.

>interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically
>sound.

Definitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The
car has a "much more expensive than it actually is" look and feel to it.

>Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it,
>but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly

Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension "interesting".
The car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm
ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet
the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and
feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.

>>If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find
>>that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
>>differently (if that's "better" is up to you).  

Well I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the
person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As
mentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, "consider the back seat
as a parcel shelf".  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not
have bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).

>>Also, there's a lot of glass

>>hot in the summer.

A/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out
a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That "lots of glass" you
mentioned is what gives the car the "very good visibility" reports you
see in all the write-ups.  Most "sports/sporty" cars don't have that
good visibility.

The complaints I've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on 
the GT.  Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent 
exhaust system.

I was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.
Since I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice, 
I was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still
waiting.   :-(

Yes.  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up
adjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy
for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  They 
did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(

I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm.  But I seriously

I guess the real question is:

Who asked the original questions, and why was it so _broad_.
Are we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing BTW)
isolated from every other factor and influence in the system?  
Or are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs (yuck)!

I just finished a project that involves real-time processing of serial
data and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has
_a lot_ to do with the "power" of a CPU in a particular application.
If what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given,
then not only is it easy, but it's cheap and quick.  If you have to
fake things (like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction), then
your cycle count goes through the roof!

well, let's _NOT_ start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose.
The orginal question was about classifying micro-processors...
having re-read the entire thread, I don't think much more can be said without
getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given.


That's it for another $0.02.

If all of those are "is"'s of identity, both syllogisms are valid.
If, however, B is a predicate, then the second syllogism is invalid.
(The first syllogism, as you have pointed out, is valid--whether B

If you know that, you probably don't need a roomful of chips, do you?
If you were going to brute force something interesting, that'd be the

I regard love as no more or less "benign" than any other Christian does.
You are merely expressing "approval" of the consequences I find therein.
Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my
(or any) religion.  "Love" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians
can write both the "gentle" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in
a passage that even the "conservatives" will quote at you :-) -- and the
words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, "Love is the unfamiliar Name
that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ..."

This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise
in my note, as will become more evident below.

>As a non-believer, I find Michael's Christianity kinder and gentler.

blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,
given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of "sin" on
another, and my unshakeable "disestablishmentarianism", Russel Turpin
and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my
legislating my own understanding of Christian love.

>If I take him at
>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were
>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If

You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of
accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) "God"
in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:

The "possibility that always exists" is that I (or, to revert to proper
time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could
persuade "Christian B" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed
constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note
that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian
argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]
prohibitions.

What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:

	A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved
	    in the Inquisition.

	B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however
	    painful this *seems*, "discipline" her children for their
	    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or
	    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example
	    "deterring" others from the same loss-of-soul.)

	A.  I point out that this "justification" of a failure in love
	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of
	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.

	B.  Burns me at the stake.

My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is
going on here has a *lot* to do with "cultural baggage."  In this case,
the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief
that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial
practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least
greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion
of sin in the exchange between A and B.

Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,
then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-
ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense
attorney.  So, "one possibility" fails in this case -- as it will fail in
may others.  At the other extreme, the "persuasion" will succeed when it
properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the
Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that
many of the victims of Inquisition will have "accepted" that they were in
fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
of charges brought against them.)

The point is that the "persuasion" breaks down when the parties do NOT
share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main
thrust of the Inquisition, against "heresy", it is *bound* to break down
in precisely the "worst" cases.  The "conservative" (I don't think that
is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,
that he is "justified" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to
a "greater good."  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow
the gospel, as if one's theories about "sin" entitled one to cast aside
Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).

I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.

>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow
>man?) And what is the "right thing"?  And how does one go about
>loving god? 

Well, the whole *point* of making these the "base" commandments is that
they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a
law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful
to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a
personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great
Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were
God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A
demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping
up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important
that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  "Conservatives"
may twist this "act as if you were God" to mean "lay down rules for other
people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules."
They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a
lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy
IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation "against
God" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the "conservatives" have
confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other
people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard
American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.

>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo
>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the
>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.

And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged
*different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,
it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular
(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.
It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very
little, if anything, in the way of "commandments" -- so little that
the "Christians" who desperately *want* commandments go "mining" for
them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))
for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus
specifically "gives" as "a commandment" to us is "love one another."

	[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson
	 that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that
	 SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll
	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why
	 there is a huge amount of "cultural baggage" involved.]

You are quite right that this is "goo" if one is looking for an ethical
system.

But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our
society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It
may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems
-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.

>I am glad that a few Christians,

I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads
of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?
[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up
the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th
century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the
gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]

In rec.autos you write:

>if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission,
>it can't be half bad..  :-)

This McLaren auto-transmission (I still think it's only half auto,
but You may be right) has NOTHING to do with Your GM, Chrysler, Volvo,
or whatever auto transmission. It's a normal manual transmission
gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do
the shifting. 

That means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out 
minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions 
(Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) don't tell You, when to shift,
either. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage
with Your stock auto-trannie: They are EXPENSIVE.

As long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on 
'normal' cars I'm gonna stick with my manual. I just can't see an
advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the
loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). But
then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.

There's no point in making a religion out of this, I just wanted to
point out a few technical facts and MY OWN opinion, so there's
no need for a flame war.

Firearm?  Let's not even consider long knives (swords), which were also
common militia weapons in the 18th century, and which, if anything, are
often restricted more heavily than firearms.  Whatever sense gun control

Possibly because gay/bi men are less likely to get married?

I won't even recommend books from my congregation.  What you ask sounds
attractive but it is dangerous.  As a new Christian you don't want to be
contaminated with other people's interpretation.  Steep your self in
scripture, and discuss with other christians.  Read if your must but
remember that what other people write is their interpretation.  God has
promised to give you light, so ask for it.

Don't wait too long before attaching yourself to church.  Just remember to
always compare what they teach you with scripture like the Bereans did.

Saudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering

IDENTITY
========

_____
<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?

  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily
  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their
  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your
  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,
  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see
  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you
  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete
  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.

  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message
  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This
  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the
  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This
  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET
  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires
  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and
  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the
  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked
  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be
  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of
  real machines and represent real transfer routes.

<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?

  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,
  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of
  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication
  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for
  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity
  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive
  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can
  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.

  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',
  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is
  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled
  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was
  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and
  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their
  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.

  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of
  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is
  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he
  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular
  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally
  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many
  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better
  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more
  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it
  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the
  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in
  exerting pressure for acceptance.

  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating
  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. 
  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques
  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital
  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. 
  Many government functions and services are based on identification,
  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of
  many government organizations push toward stronger identification
  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?

  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive
  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect
  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly
  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or
  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will
  literally be magnified exponentially.

<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?

  Your email address may contain information that influences people's
  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as
  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a
  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,
  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In
  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others
  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the
  order that new users are added to the system.

  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your
  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this
  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The
  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on
  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network
  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields
  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names
  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as
  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the
  computer receiving mail.

  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an
  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more
  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known
  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist
  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).

_____
<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?

  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another
  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.
  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help
  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve
  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also
  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address
  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the
  time and patience of others so use them minimally.

  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the
  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:

    finger user@here.there.everywhere

  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer
  named in the address for information on the user named.  The
  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may
  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:

  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is
    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.
  
  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer
    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger
    utility may return this response in other situations.
  
  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some
    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will
    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all
    actual full names of users kept in a local database.
  
  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the
  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often
  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid
  user ID's to `crack' passwords.

  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. 
  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses
  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just
  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use
  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out
  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be
  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with
  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one
  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the
  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through
  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace
  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.

_____
<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?

  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept
  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent
  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge
  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. 
  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual
  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic 
  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are
  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique
  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on
  multiple machines anywhere in the world.

  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances
  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to
  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an
  individual.  
  
  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,
    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address
    in the From: line.
  
  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as
    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. 

  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:
    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many
    hackers.
    
  The status and path information prepended to messages by
  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while
  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in
  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic
  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification
  on the internet:

  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving
    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for
    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between
    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding
    addresses and bouncing mail.
  
  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,
    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.
  
  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers
    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved
    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. 
  
  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if
    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even
    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different
    interpretations at different sites.
  
  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly
  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was
  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the
  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic
  is email, comprising  millions of messages.

_____
<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?

  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images
  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of
  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.
  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts
  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises
  in privacy.

  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'
  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend
  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted
  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity
  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.


PRIVACY
=======

_____
<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?

  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and
  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to
  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the
  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do
  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, 
  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not
  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly
  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users
  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want
  any privacy, some expect and demand it.

_____
<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?

  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing
  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for
  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.
  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the
  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted
  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws
  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These
  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules
  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global
  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong
  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic
  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not
  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly
  discourages its regulation.

_____
<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?

  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with
    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the
    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the
    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes
    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies
    with supposedly vast funding and resources.
  
  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by
    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine
    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic
    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to
    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even
    possible.
  
  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures
    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can
    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for
    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is
    prohibitive for casual use.

  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major
  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks
  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost
  completely defused with the use of cryptography.
    
_____
<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?

  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may
  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. 
  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal
  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to
  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat
  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the
  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited
  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to
  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account
  without detection.

  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly
  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what
  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login
  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or
   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the
  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it
  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. 
  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting
  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks
  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on
  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user
  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of
  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').
  
  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features
  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies
  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX
  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed
  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'
  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect
  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).
  
  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for
  various reasons:
  
  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by
    someone else. 

  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely
    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over
    many weeks. 

  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. 

  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or
    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and
    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous
    ones.

  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on
    ``X Windows (in)security''.

  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much
  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help
  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and
  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:

  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.
  - Make sure to logout always.
  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.
  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.
  - Avoid password references in email.
  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.
  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be
    considerate.

  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your
  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX
  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or
  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for
  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you
  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware
  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain 
  passwords.

_____
<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?

  The most important privacy considerations are related to file
  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature
  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with
  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on
  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these
  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. 
  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete
  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede
  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a
  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)
  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list
  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.
 
  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the
  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator
  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights
  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell
  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary
  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.

  Examples
  --------

    traver.lance % ls -ld ~
    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/

  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home
  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what
  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a
  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and
  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For
  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and
  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The
  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to
  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They
  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy
  is completely invisible to them.

    traver.lance % ls -l msg
    -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg
    traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg
    traver.lance % ls -l msg
    -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg

  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights
  from `group' and `other'. 
  
  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list
  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files
  and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,
  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following
  is possible:

    ls foo

  These commands would fail independent of file rights:
  
    ls -l foo
    ls -l foo/file
    cat foo/file
    cd foo

  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are
  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'
  readable file named `file':
  
    ls -l foo/file
    cat foo/file
    cd foo
  
  The following commands fail:
  
    ls foo
    ls -l foo

<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?

  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena
  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop
  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing
  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. 
  The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via
  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application
  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a
  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many
  situations the client is an application program running on the same
  machine as the server.

  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation
  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a
  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this
  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated
  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue
  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be
  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where
  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is
  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X
  Windows.

  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design
  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely
  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt
  that display or read it electronically based on access to the
  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections
  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises
  because the security is completely based on machine addresses
  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is
  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):
  
  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed
  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in
  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a
  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not
  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and
  > mutual trust does not exist. 
  
  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some
  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0
  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost
  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an
  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to
  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display
  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or
  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on
  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks
  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security
  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this
  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'
  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X
  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). 

  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default 
  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority
  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the
  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code
  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new
  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with
  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to
  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of
  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other
  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find
  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security 
  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local
  sites often update this software infrequently because installation
  is extremely complex.

_____
<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?

  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are
  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for
  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic
  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every
  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting
  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is
  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually
  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth
  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies
  are only recently being established that afford high priority to
  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some
  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:

  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous
    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a
    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),
    such as a university. 
  
  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement
    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving
    computer searches have still not been strongly established and
    tested legally.

  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in
    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an
    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human
    other than the recipient.

  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local
    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be
    overridden.

  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of 
    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail 
    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.

  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly
  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has
  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators
  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or
  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email
  policies.''

_____
<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?

  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke
  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading
  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or
  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. 
  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator
  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in
  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are
  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for
  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators
  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.

  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.
  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator
  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by
  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's
  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are
  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as
  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on
  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means
  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring
  unpopular opinions.)
  
  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to
  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition
  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of
  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe
  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options
  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next
  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'
  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a
  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).

  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system
  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings
  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or 
  entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most
  commonly associated with the following `abuses':

  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'
  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material
  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the
    poster instead of citing the content of the message
  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness
  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups
    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive
    files

  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and
  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via
  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the
  internet can be construed as representative of their parent
  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in
  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent
  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case
  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House
  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some
  guidelines:

  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.
  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private
    communication.
  - Use a disclaimer.
  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).
  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be
    proprietary or `internal'.

<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?

  The public information of your identity and account is mostly
  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. 
  
  - You have control over most of this information with the utility
    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use
    `passwd -f').
   
  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is
    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. 
    
  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is
    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.
    
  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE
    
  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file
    in your home directory.
    
  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult
  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to
  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). 
  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from
  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely
  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not
  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your
  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on
  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on
  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very
  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.

  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different
  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and
  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See
  below.

______
<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?

  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration
  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely
  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at
  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely
  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often
  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more
  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are
  extremely strict.

  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you
  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files
  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send
  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he
  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,
  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ
  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,
  which can potentially be misused.

______
<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?

  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an
  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large
  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science
  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as
  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and
  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to
  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).

  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been
  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread
  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some
  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The
  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually
  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is
  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).

  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely
  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders
  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted
  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to
  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email
  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently
  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet
  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost
  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as
  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).
  
______
<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?

  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or
  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a
  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate
  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,
  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will
  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and
  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that
  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard
  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.
  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged
  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with
  the internet.
  
  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the
  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to
  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform
  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption
  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is
  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.

  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy
  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly
  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government
  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe
  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct
  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new
  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming
  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out
  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In
  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong
  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically
  unstoppable.
  
  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure
  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two
  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of
  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met
  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,
  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections
  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and
  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will
  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few
  years.


ANONYMITY
=========

_____
<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?

  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the
  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on
  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently
  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a
  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.
  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single
  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may
  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with
  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an
  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a
  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user
  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the
  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at
  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some
  service and hide all  signs of the association. 
  
  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently
  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking
  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. 
  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed
  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. 
  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will
  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.

_____
<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?

  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or
  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of
  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the
  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be
  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true
  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.

  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague
  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as
  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information
  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,
  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,
  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or
  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information
  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where
  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely
  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police
  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of
  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.
  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with
  assurances of anonymity.

_____
<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?

  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in
  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as
  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be
  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially
  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF
  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining
  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous
  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.

  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to
  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently
  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.
  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee
  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.

_____
<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?

  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous
  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by
  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the
  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary
  for the same person for different machine address email
  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed
  to the server containing the final destination. The server
  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information
  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the
  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. 
  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity
  mentioned above.

  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer
  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are
  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and
  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on
  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain
  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail
  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a 
  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence
  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;
  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.
  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. 
  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. 
  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any
  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,
  although actually may be held liable regardless.

  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:
  
  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of
    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained
    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of
    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been
    implemented yet.

  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could
    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the
    use of cryptography for basic protection,.

  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or
    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.
  
  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic
    that goes through them.

  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. 

  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these
    operators are basically  network users who do not own the
    equipment and are accountable  to their own system
    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic
    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,
    regarding it as illicit use. 

  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous
    server operator by the user.

  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP
  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary
  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the
  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by
  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data
  and logs of network port connection information may be retained
  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this
  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some
  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to
  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished
  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually
  happening occasionally but infrequently.

  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and 
  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.

_____
<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?

  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet
  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,
  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to
  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to
  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many
  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the
  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). 
  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''
  before proceeding.

  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a
  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.
  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed
  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar
  consequences can ensue.

  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and 
  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.

_____
<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?

  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available
  to the general internet community, and these services should be
  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its
  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not
  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and
  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software
  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: 
  
  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous
    return addresses. 
  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages
    unaltered. 
  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced
    to a remailer are common.
  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly
    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email
    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with
    the use of passwords.
  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.
  
  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these
  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The
  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official
  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is
  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and
  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable
  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular
  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system
  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting
  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have
  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the
  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only
  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less
  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least
  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for
  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,
  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.
  
_____
<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?

  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase
  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that
  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,
  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an
  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers
  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple
  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be
  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even
  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers
  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses
  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)
  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message
  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.
  
  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,
  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem
  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many
  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a
  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in
  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity
  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and
  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had
  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the
  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. 

  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may
  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are
  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could
  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if
  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may
  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread
  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It
  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new
  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater
  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the
  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social
  acceptance of Usenet.

What if.......

What if the FBI thought that tear gas would force the Davidians out;
at least the mothers and the children, so they (the FBI) did not
bother to think about the effect of tear gas on young children......

What if the FBI knew they killed several of the children by using
tear gas......(let`s assume the FBI knew via their listening devices)

What if the FBI saw fire accidently break out at one end of the
building, e.g. by an upset oil lamp.......

What if the FBI thought they could finally force the rest of the
Davidians out AND also destroy the evidence that they (the FBI) had
killed the children by starting a fire at the other end......

What if the FBI miscalculated and not many of the rest of the Davidians
made it out.......?????

Answer:  What happened.

Ah yes, that is exactly what I would do.  Hold Bible study. Take a nap.
Always a wise course of action when you're being gassed.

I don't believe there was a "suicide pact".  I believe that Koresh
wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers.
In fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' stories.

Yes, that's right.  And once the whole compound was demolished, where

The building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS?  That's almost

Hm, an interesting notion.  We'll see.

Actually, on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and

For six hours they were trapped?  The building was not "destroyed"

Six hours to move it away.  Or COME OUT.

Right.  For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at

It's ultimately irrelevant who "lit" the fire.  They had ample opportunity

Most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually.  They tend

I have NEVER judged them by their religion, but by their ACTIONS.

If they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would
have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.  Instead, they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID, if not
IRRATIONAL.  The first was to stockpile weapons.  The second was to
shoot federal agents.  The third was to stay inside.

Just as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy
weapon at him, I don't think the FBI deserves blame in this case.

Any state that the CIA does not control is called "state that is linked
to terrorism/militants/fundamentalists etc.."
Meanwhile Even Egyptian "experts" who hate The Islamic movement admit
that what is happening in Egypt is spontaneous and most of the time a

Can anybody see any contradiction between the above and the first

When it comes to Egypt, all human rights, ethics, principles can

Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM:

I put 2 256K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra 700 (in the 2 slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots) and I got no results whatsoever.  I have been told that
the built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on
a Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel still
lists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.

Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?
Do you have to do something to activate them?
Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?

BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.

The reference to it's not yet being ethics is dubious. You have used the terms
absolute, objective and others interchangeably. Same with moral values, values,
at all, worth, measuers, and usefulness. You infer from them as if they were
the same.
 
To the IF. When the If is not fulfilled, your intermission is a waste of time.
Assuming that you don't intend this, it is reasonable to conclude that you
want to argue a point.
 
You have made a interesting statement here, namely that of the disinterested
observer. There is no such thing in morals. Probably the shortest proof for
objective and morality being a contradiction.

Fine. And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. I could
name quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (Not that that wasn't
mentioned before). In other words, you have nothing to fulfill your strong
claims with.

Clutching a straw. I don't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were
loaded terms are fixpoints. Those who deny the morality of freedom make quite
clear what they say, their practice is telling. Yes, there are even those who
are willingly unfree. It is quite common in religions, by the way. For one,
there is a religion which is named Submission.
 
Don't even try to argue that submission is freedom.

Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a
32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. 
Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range
0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look
rather odd.

So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:

>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>much more complicated.

>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much
>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.

In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.
Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.

As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If
that was not what you meant, then:

>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
>places so far.)

Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting
made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry
if I misunderstood.

>You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

Subject: Upgrading to Windows NT
Nntp-Posting-Host: 127.0.0.1
Organization: Performance Systems Int'l
X-Mailer: PSILink-DOS (3.3)
Lines: 65

I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice.

First a general description of the machine as follows:
 Motherboard: Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache
      (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it)
 Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256)
 ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board
 primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller
 secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller
 tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller
 planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port
 Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller
  future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface.
 Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board
 (ugly dos software drives the latter)

Applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quicken
and Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audio
work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo,
and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files.  Also I use
Stacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she 
won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from 
Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom 
used offline files.  

I plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly
tempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around
with the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the 
shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can
hope can't I, after all, I have work to do).

The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and 
hardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the 
upgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I
still need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) 
from some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation
goes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'm
allergic to command lines!  I plan to run a "pure" NT system.  Also, will 
NT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently 
have stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite 
Disk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the 
system (It's cramped now).

I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT 
version?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk
will be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)
a comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask 
Chili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd
rather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without
DOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?

Any feedback or advice (including "forget NT" with good reasons) is much
appreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better
multitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up
the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),
and I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe
there are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing 
about them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?)

Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net.

Thanks,
Nathan Gregory

OK, I don't use CView anymore, but I saw that no one had explaind this
"bug" in the thread, so here goes:

It is NOT the fault of CView.  It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a
floppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes
that file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT
from the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true,
and has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.

The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave
files open unless it's actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).

Well, I am placing a file at my ftp today that contains several
polygonal descriptions of a head, face, skull, vase, etc. The format
of the files is a list of vertices, normals, and triangles. There are
various resolutions and the name of the data file includes the number
of polygons, eg. phred.1.3k.vbl contains 1300 polygons.


In order to get the data via ftp do the following:

	1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil
	2) login as anonymous, guest as the password
	3) cd pub/dabro
	4) binary
	5) get cyber.tar.Z

Once you get the data onto your workstation:

	1) uncompress data.tar.Z
	2) tar xvof data.tar

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Getting back to the original question in this thread:

I experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those
described.  In my case, it turned out that I was developing Type I
diabetes.  Although I never sought direct confirmation of this from my
doctor, I think that the breathing problem was associated with the
presence of ketones due to the diabetes.

I think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting
their food intake drastically.  I don't know if this relevant in this
case, but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating
properly.

GEN 1:25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle

GEN 2:19  And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast of  the

Even your Bible cannot agree on how things were created.  Why should we

Good heavens, you mean my good friend Wes Collins, who took his wife and two 
small children into the jungles of Guatemala, despite dangers from primitive 
conditions and armed guerillas, so that the indigenous people groups their 
could have the Bible in their native languages--the young man who led Bible 
studies in our church, who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding 
faith in the Lord of Love--you mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic *SPY* 
whose _real_ reason for going was to exploit and oppress the ignorant and 
unsuspecting masses?  Imagine my surprise!  I never would have thought it of 
him.

How was this terrible deceit discovered?  What exactly was the "cultural 
interference" they were caught committing?  Attempting to persuade the locals 
that their ancestral gods were false gods, and their sacrifices (including 
human sacrifices in some cases) were vain?  Destroying traditional lifestyles 
by introducing steel tools, medical vaccines, and durable clothes?  Oh and by 
the way, who did the denouncing?

I am terribly shocked to hear that my friend Wes, who seemed so nice, was 
really such a deceitful tool of the devil.  Please provide me with specific 
documentation on this charge.  There is some risk that I may not believe it 
otherwise.

I would guess that it requires X, almost certainly DV/X, which commonly
uses the GO32 (DJGPP) setup for its programs.  If you don't have DV/X
running, you can't get anything which requires interfacing with X.

04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES

By David Ljunggren

MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons
x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it
might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.

Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest
offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in
the Transcaucasian region soaring.

The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the
Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending 
planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.

It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about
the impermissibility of such actions," the journalists quoted Duliyan as 
saying.

"If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate
measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft
units."

Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the
conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which
more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.

The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to
Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.

A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly
on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket
launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.

Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops
and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where
they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.

"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the
country which is affording military assistance over our airspace," he said.

Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops 
involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.

Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive
along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.

"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent
inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)
leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire," the agency said.

Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in
Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of
Commonwealth leaders.

"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the
protection of the Karabakh population," Tass quoted him as saying.
     
At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have
collapsed.

"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the
legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh," he
said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not 
been recognised by any other country.

Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future
peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.

Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender
Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with
Armenia, had resigned.

Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.
Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of
Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official
confirmation.

 I know this is a little weird, but I know that World magazine (you know,
National Geo. for children) did a very simple and concise article on Kirlian
photography.  They had some neat pictures, too.  A friend of mine's mother had
a book on Kirlian photography, only it's photographs took a radiologist to 
interpret.  They (World magazine) warned us all that it was very dangerous,
probably to stop curious children from experimenting with it.  Mind you, this
was 10 years ago, at least.  (And boy, does that say something about my age)

I can't help myself.
I've tried to be rational, 
to look the other way,
but everytime it happens, 
its uncontrollable.

I hate pre'80s motorcycles.

At first I thought it was a phase.  I though I would
get used to them.  It didn't happen.  I tried gazing
at CB750s and 900 customs, but each time I sadistically
pictured them being hurled off of large precipice
(I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering and
taking holiday snaps, but I can't figure that part out).

What am I to do?  Everytime I read a .sig containing 
some spoked wheel wonder, I shudder and feel pity that
the poor soul has suffered enough.  I imagine the owner
scrapping out his (or her) living in a discarded Maytag
refridgerator box, tucked in next to their CX500.

I'm hoping for some deliverance.  I had in the past loathed
the Milwaukee machine, but I can actually begin to understand
some of the preaching.  There must be hope.

the same rubbish over and over again may make something a 
"fact" in whatever backwater you are posting from, but it doesn't

Subject: Too Many Europeans in NHL
Organization: Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada
Lines: 50



   Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:

Canadians: 400
Americans: 100
Europeans: 100

   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.

   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the
Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like "Bure" "Konstantinov" and
"Borshevshky". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,
and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well. 

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about "Pavel Bure, the
Russian Rocket" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a
Canucks fan to begin with ;-). 

    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and
some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even
better hockey players. It's all hype. This "European mystique" is sickening,
but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.

    I just don't want them on mine.

It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important
than trying to interface windows with a way for blind people to use it.
If someone made a voice recognition/multimedia (sound) oriented program,
it would probably been more effective.  I don't know what the original
purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question
though.

			RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992

		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE

I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC

	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to
panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right
with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your 
only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the 
Tribulation.  "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be 
saved." - Matthew 24:13

II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION

	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of
the rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as "the time of Jacob's
(Israel's) trouble" (Jere 30:7) and "Daniel's Seventieth Week" (Dan 9), this 
period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.

III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM

	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community 
(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will
be tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable 
possession during the Tribulation.

IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it
is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can
quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, 
Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to
unfold before you.  

V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray 
and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual 
strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the
sake of Christ.  

VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED
ONES DIE AS MARTYRS

	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he
will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,
or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be
useless.  "And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and 
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that
no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, 
or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding
calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number
is 666" - Revelation 13:16-18.  
	The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of 
humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed
in the past, such as the Holocaust.
[or maybe the crusades? -M]
You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's
rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) "...I saw
under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and
for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of 
them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, 
until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be
killed as they were, was completed." Revelation 6:9, 11.
	His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image
or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ "...And I saw the souls of 
those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of 
God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark
on their foreheads or on the hands." - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every
form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor
will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, 
torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take
the mark.  
	If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,
you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.
[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]
You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and
gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake
of Fire.  "...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his 
mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His 
indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the 
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb." -Revelation 
14:9-10 

[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to
the first 5,000 at the stadium --M] 

VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL

	Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government
until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is 
important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are
extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.
	The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or
mountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least
populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay 
attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.
["As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep
into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school
closings" --M] 
Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without
the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste
from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.
[Get a good water filter. --M]
Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,
batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to 
survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.

VIII. TRUST NO ONE
	
	There will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's
government.  Be on the lookout.
[Perot supporters take note --M]

IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST

	It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,
for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will
bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel 
11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a
half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be 
physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and 
personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic
expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which
he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural 
power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will
be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.
[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]
	The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who
will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  
All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and
a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.

X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!

	The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of
Christ.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you 
will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  
	Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of 
your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take
the mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or
remain saved, but this time you will have to be "faithful unto death."

	May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!

Ahhh, of course. Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events 
like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those 
TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline
bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of 
Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any
bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be 
bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah,
those wonderful "mainstream moderates" with whom Israel is attempting
to negotiate.

Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians
than by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads.
I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary 
_Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather 
inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to "the cause" of
whichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone
else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-
squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic
on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my 
favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back 
the execution of a "collaborator?"  3 photos:
1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint.
2) The "collaborator" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.
3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the "collaborator
shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.

Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights.
Remember Black September?
Ok, so they just tried to take over Jordan, big deal.

I'm rambling now, but are you getting what I'm saying?

Please help if you can with the following strange problem:

  the error. Sometimes it occurs more often, sometimes

    You're being too generous to the communists, I think.  In practice,
communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_
productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of "kulaks"
in the USSR is a good instance of this.
    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder
just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would
have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed
him off, or been killed?
    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,
load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that
most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of
obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,
if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die
crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to
socialists in Chile.
    It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimes
it's a sheer waste of time.

Hey folks,

Saw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday, April 17.  It was the game
where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,
two-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans 
threw the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer --
too bad, huh?)

Well, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it
was cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  The
wind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.

At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on
the field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed
mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run
out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths
the infield) and grab the trash.

It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given
anything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!

Whaddaya think?

>Ouch!  Thanks for trying it.

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months
ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform
real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates
sustainable by today's modems.

This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device,
compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples
recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts
it with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio
back to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio stream
is 13 kbits/s (!).

My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days,
certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity
(audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I
ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember,
though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can
certainly be improved.

The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de,
I believe (look for gsm or toast).  I used Eric Young's DES
implementation but I no longer know where I got it from.

Deliberate misinterpretation of a persons statement?  (By cutting out

He never addresses the issue of extreemist peace people not holding true

Ignoring the challenge?  (He ignores the challenge that extreemists for

the world, and have even turned quite violent.  (Witness, Chicago, summer
1968)).

So this year you had a game on SCNY, a game on SCA, a game on ESPN,
and if the Rangers hadn't crashed and burned, you would have had a
game on MSG.  What are you complaining about?

I seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage.  I
even remember Orioles' games being shown in the DC area instead of
hockey.  And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other
games because its feature game was over?  Sound familiar?

This year I'm getting twice the coverage.  I can see all the Caps
games *plus* the games ESPN shows.  I think it's great that hockey is
back on ESPN.  IMHO, they're doing a great job especially considering
the baseball contract they have to work around.

Organization: University of Arizona MIS Department

NNTP-Posting-Host: bpavms.bpa.arizona.edu
News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41


    This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help.

    I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.

    When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many
    of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT
    2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when
    I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under
    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than
    my shell running.

    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some
    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  

    1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are
    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at
    plugging this leak?

    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?

    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with
    this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.

    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was
    hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different
    than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)

    5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less
    likely my code will eat resources?

    6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for
    specifically?

    Thanks for your help.  As this is a common problem and I have seen only
    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
    me email.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I've heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about
it.Remember the Treaty of Sevres-as a consequence of being in the Axis powers
in WWI.The Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their
minorities ie. Greeks,Armenians,Kurds(I must say Turk-Kurd relations are 
improving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours.
The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted 
Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the 
German people).The Greeks who had an army there,were there with BRITISH
and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres.
    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government
managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies,this was after 
the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently,
FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the 
FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH
as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.

Astronomy & Space magazine's UK telephone newsline carries the times to
see the Russian Space Station Mir which will be visible every EVENING (some
time between 9 o'clock and midnight) from April 27 to May 7. It's about as
bright as Jupiter at its best. There are two cosmonuats on board.

For the time to watch, tel. 0891-88-19-50 (48p/min peak 36p/min all other
times, but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a
few pence).

E-mail reports of sightings would be appreciated: give lat/long and UT (a
few seconds accuracy if possible) when it passes ABOVE or BELOW any bright
star (say brighter than mag. 3), planet or Moon.

With Moon in evening sky also, note that from somewhere in U.K. Mir will
pass in front of the Moon each night! Please alert local clubs to the
telephone newsline, and general public as Mir can cause quite a stir!

I have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning Epilepsy and
seizures.  I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with
Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a
message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it
is again.

Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and
seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share
information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two
other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.

If you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will
make it happen and provide you with the details.

BTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my
research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this
service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program
searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology
works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have
been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded
and used to improve the system.

This database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new
information.  To try it out, do the following

	telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca
	login: chat

	Then select the Epilepsy item from the menu of databases.

Is it just me, or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield?  He 
misplayed Martinez fly-out into a double against the Expos, misplayed
Alou's single into a triple (Alou tagged out at 3rd after over-sliding 
the bag) and now he misplays another out into a 3 run triple...add in his
wonderful batting average and we have one heck of a player!

-Anyone know the current driver version for it??
-Can it handle the 16-bit grayscale card, if i get the video option
-Why would it be hating my hard drive?(can't use the accelerator and

It appears as if the problem is related to the 68882/50's need for very fast
(and clean) signal transitions.  I got some email (Vielen Dank, Thomas) stating
that Motorola provides a solution for this problem in their 68030 manual.  
Since my manual (1989) predates the 50 MHz 68030/68882s I couldn't find it.
Could someone please email me the specifics?

I sold my '86 Sprint last April with 95k on it.  I'd driven it since
the previous July, putting 20k miles on it.  The sensor light used to
light up regularly, starting about 5k miles after I bought it.  
My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment,
so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement.  Performance (hah,
if you could call it that) did not change.  Perhaps emissions increased,
but how much emissions could a CA-registered 3 cylinder engine produce?
That was a neat car, I held the engine block easily in one hand!  Has
anyone ever driven the 'Turbo' variant?  Just curious...

FIGURE IN ADL SPY CASE ARRESTED AT S.F. AIRPORT

    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon
    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI
    interrogation.

By Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer

San Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the
Philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law
enforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation
League was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police
said Friday.

Thomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after
the FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday
night after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard
was returning home.

Gerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday
morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count
each of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.

If convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and
$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police
argued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. 
A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a
sheriff's spokeswoman said.

Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,
with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and "wanted to have
his day in court," said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and
one of two arresting officers.

Gerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from
1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett
said.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to
disclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he
was indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.

Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network
operated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil
rights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave
criminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said
he has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.

Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's
home computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950
groups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized
under search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los
Angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.

Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,
James Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the
interview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged
snooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any
criminal wrongdoing.

Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling
intelligence to South Africa.

ADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent
contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal
activity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest
"has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on
the case."

Arab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,
according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to
pursue the investigation.

"We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly
disclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement," said
James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.

Police, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the
inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A
former police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited
Gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.

"I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but
we didn't think it would happen this quickly," Capt. Willett said. 
"This development really speeds up our timetable on the case."

During his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly
regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence
division.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.

After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement
and fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of
Manila.

Gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines
Airlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard
after his six-month hiatus, police said.

"He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked
look on his face," Willett said.  "Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'"

It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the
formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the
disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's
memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible
with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written
Is that correct?

   We don't disagree on this.  All I said was that a right is whatever
you or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn't
come into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly,
the people); from that point it defined legal rights.  "Common law"
rights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on a
Bill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they
demanded from the government.  Legitimate or illegitimate, power is
power.  That's why the federal government can force states to grant
their citizens rights they don't wish to: In a slugging match, the feds
win.  Period.

   And you're right, this doesn't belong in sci.space.  I've said my
peace.  No more frome me on rights (at least not here).

Nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this.  It does not
appear in several long published accounts by Irgun participants.
Even some Irgun propagandists do not make this claim.

>Secondly, the Irgun

Several members of the Irgun attacking party, including the leader,
deposited personal declarations in the Irgun archives (Jabotinsky
Institute, Tel-Aviv) which state that the Lehi proposed to "liquidate
the village after the conquest".  It seems the Begin overruled
this plan, however the willingness of many of the attackers to
seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive
character evidence.

>The village was attacked only for its military significance. 

The Haganah tried to get the Irgun to attack a village with
real military significance, but it was considered too hard.  
The soft target of Deir Yassin was chosen instead.

>In fact,
>a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before

There was intention (probably originating with Begin) to give such
a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before
reaching the village.  Everyone knows that.

Hi
	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3
86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix
from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from
them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say "Buy the memory
from us" or something like that.)

	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a
1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB
of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.
Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I
asked them why, and all I got was "Your point is well taken, but
Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects."

	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to
get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken.

	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805
cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are "less
busy".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805
product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),
although evenn that might be a misprint.

	Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out
there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I
coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.

Thanks.

Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation
Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done
some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original
announcement.) 

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is
the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training
of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe
design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.
Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,
Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.

I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at
MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an
F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening
experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year
or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to
see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines
for future space craft use.

If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would
be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty
have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the
receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they

Dorin, of all the criticism of my post expressed on t.p.m., this one I accept.
I regret that aspect of my post. It is my hope that the occupation will end (and
the accompanying loss of life) but I believe that stiff resistance can help to 
achieve that end. Despite what some have said on t.p.m., I think that there is 
a point when losses are unacceptable. The strategy drove U.S. troops out of 
Lebanon, at least.

From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler)
>Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of
>the Acts of the Apostles can be found?

1] A english translation of this can be found in:
   "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an
   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson
   (London, 1923).

2] Another work that might be useful is:
   "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and
   Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;
   reprinted 1970).

(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the
text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it
actually contains an english translation or not.)

3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:
   "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in
   Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).

4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the
early '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)

5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if
you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension
an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:
   "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible
   Society, 1971).

Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of
the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went
behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in
the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are
included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).

In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:
   "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full
   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and
   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...
   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the
   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the
   evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272).

>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has
>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the
>differences are between the long and the short forms.

6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the
ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter
(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is
usually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex
Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).

7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition
(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the
text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains
18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.

8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations
in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main
difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if
you prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems
to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific
cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.

9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the
more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything
approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents
purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be
examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the
Alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.

Anyone who dies for a "cause" runs the risk of dying for a lie.  As for
people being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters and
charlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield had
been the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  
Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't the
first to be "witnessed."  What sets him apart?

Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and 
megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,
Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.
Koresh is a non-issue.

Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in your

Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something is
written in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plus
the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if you
do quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with 
supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.

Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you 
define the world "total," but I would imagine a "total sacrafice [sp]
of everything for God's sake" would involve more than a time commitment.

You are correct about our tendency to "box everything into time units."
Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)
television?

  Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by
  mid-season. C'mon, the Phillies haven't proved anything yet. Atlanta
  was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having
  a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the
  division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST   
  have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect
  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good
  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils
  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will
  improve dramatically.  
  No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team.

What about guns with non-lethal bullets, like rubber or plastic bullets. Would
those work very well in stopping an attack?

I think Scalia's point was that you get one chance.  If new information
comes out later, tough.  If the conviced want justice, they have to hope
the governor is feeling charitable.

There's a guy on death row in Texas that was denied a new trial, dispite
evidence of his inocents.

Instead of reading between the lines, try to think a little bit. OK,
if that's way too difficult to you, here are some hints.

Indeed, the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on
the local police, if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie
that your mom is telling you on the phone. So, guess what they will
do? Propose that the new technology is removed? Or implement some
"facilitations"? Of course, you won't want to wait until they get the
approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation
between two child molesters, because meanwhile those two child
molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child, right? So,
there should be some way for them to get access to those keys
-quickly-, right? Like, they could have a copy of the database, and
worry about a warrant later...

   Another pair of suggestions:
   1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay "safe"
      no matter what the pitcher does.

   2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)
      without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base
      as if walked.

This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases
considerably.  Suppose the pitcher uses up (N-1) of his N pick-off
attempts.  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base,
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it
right this time.

Would this suggestion apply to pick-off attempts per pitch, per
batter, or per base runner (on the same base)?

On my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for
use with the curses library.  Guess what they provide? :-)

Unix Press, ie. Prentice-Hall, has a programmer's guide for these
tools, referred to as the FMLI (Forms Mgmt Language Interface) and
ETI (Extended Terminal Interface), now in it's 2nd edition.  It is
ISBN 0-13-020637-7.

Paraphrased from the outside back cover:

    FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,
    and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library
    subroutines that promote fast development of application programs
    for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.

The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces
screen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a
"shell-like" environment of the "fmli" program and it's database
files.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual.

The ETI are subroutines, part of the 3X manual section, provide
support for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal
with controls built on top of the curses library.

You have one. Minimize the print manager and drag a file to it and it will
print it. You need to associate file extensions with such things as the
notepad for it to do this though.

This way to detect pre-encryption may be defeated ; one can do  
transformation of the spectrum of encrypted signal just by adding some 
pre-arranged (in the beginning of communication) function.
I think so. Say, you can do FFT of your encrypted signal.
Just thinking ...

	Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm
	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's
	got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - 
	coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign 
	in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  
	It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin 
	was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  
	BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third 
	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the 
	replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a 
	serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year 
	and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

If you are going to use one where it counts (eg:aviation, space scuttle,

for every other use you can buy a cheapie. I have a metex which is some

bought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus$125.00 (convert that to US and you see 
that it's definetly a cheapie.) So far it has proved to be accurate, taken 
moderate abuse, and has many features on it (CAP, FREQ,Transistor check, 
etc). I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
the name. Hope this helps.

I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA
board.  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.
EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I
would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  

So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does
not.

We must have been watching two different games.   The Devil had one hand on
Mario's elbow and pulling the elbow caused Mario to fall so the call was
appropriate.

Using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesn't give me a lot of
confidence in your call either.  Next time consider getting a second opinion

Subject: ST1100 ride
Keywords: heavy
Lines: 95

Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,
the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, 
became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I
took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.
They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours
before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --
surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.

Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,
50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat
Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.
Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one
MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on
the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that
Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like
a big moto party.

After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,
and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/
pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the
parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from 
the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else
into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the 
ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of
the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a
bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.

Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could 
think was "big".  Then I put one foot up.  "Heavy" came to mind very
quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to 
tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed
nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.

By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even
on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that 
did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is
on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north
of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95
splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access
highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, 
Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.
On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about
30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many
thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.

Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along
in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane 
changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this 
thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the
fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was
non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.
Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,
but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless
buzz.

The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the
brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,
decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  
The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok
in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack
oft featured in "Spencer for Hire" -- a place where you could really 
find "Spencer", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting
through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.

About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal
for "hold on tight".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second
gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a 
short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light
traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.
Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort
lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went 
until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed
there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, 
I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.

Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the "get
off in a mile" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted
to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were
several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the 
slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could 
see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed
to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad
out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put
the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side
stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.


My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,
hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than 
list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.

Funny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no

not a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are

  Correct. Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return
  memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does
  not shrink).

  Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around
  that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,
  attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man
  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment
  only dies after all attachments are gone.
  Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)
  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,
  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more
  shared memory segment.
  Terrible, but it works.

Good point, but it is being immoral in our opinion.  We don't let them choose,
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them.

  For someone to lay claim to an alternative

I admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense, but have little basis
for it as of yet.  How far can such a concept be extended?

Do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but 
not him.  After all, he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he
chose.  On what basis do we condemn other societies besides, here's the buzz

societies?

Organization: CSLI, Stanford University

Lines: 34


The ATF agent interviewed on "Street Stories" reported that the raid was
ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was 
coming. WHY?

I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,
and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part
in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even 
suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the
context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, 
as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof
might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests
for sufficient fire power. 

Important dates: 
Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.
Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.	   

On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon
ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate
in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have
an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated
agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some
group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially
at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent 
on "Street Stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get 
ready fast", as "they know we are coming". I believe this attack continued, 
even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top 
down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to
come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.

It's not the fact that it can't exist that bothers me.   It's 
the fact that you don't seem to be able to define it.

If I wanted to hear about indefinable things that might in

               === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===

This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general
description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and
some suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting'
will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of
newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos

understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at
least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please
subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the
documentation provided there.

Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:

rec.autos.tech

is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,
construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely
inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.

rec.autos.sport

is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving
automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply
to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,
spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are
largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are
inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.
Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid
advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)

rec.autos.driving

is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.
Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert
your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.

rec.autos.vw

is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership
of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,
Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing
list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence
of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many
different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be
created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as
a mailing list.

rec.audio.car

is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,
the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and
so is mentioned here.

rec.autos.antique

is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years
old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)

alt.hotrod

is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the
rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing
list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing
performance vehicles.

alt.autos.rod-n-custom

also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar
American hobby of customizing older cars.

alt.autos.karting

for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.

rec.autos

is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.


Crossposting:

Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on
the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear
in all of the newsgroups listed.

Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on
Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is
appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular
audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector
articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are
almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact
that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or
rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.

Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually
inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is
truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:
to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.

Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in
particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of
radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.

Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about
the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in
rec.autos.

It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of
articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to
misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these
three.  The life you save may be your own.

Distribution:

There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to
(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution
field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve
as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.

The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, 
the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,
New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the
following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article
headers, and on article content.

1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford
Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in
either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange
reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)

2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which
your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences
between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,
all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel
injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These
differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.
Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant
spread of misinformation.

3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;
in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas
Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition
of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used
abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos
reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.

4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when
possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can
(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state
abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted
to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put
"ny,nj" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated
values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so
you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely
to be supported in your area.

The Dangers of Overgeneralization:

To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:
Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is
true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a
1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly
different from those in Idaho.

The Need for Adequate Specification:

When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;
e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,
model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be
quite useless.


Concerning Lemons:

At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or
two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by
announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all
`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from
the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful
information.


Concerning Flames:

As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most
likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how
to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section
of this posting):

If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a
minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and
you'll get exactly what you deserve.

If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can
cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe
bald, unsupported assertions.

Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.


Asking the Question:

It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please
send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to
end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest
I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses
to this request'.

Answering the Question:

If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.
Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on
defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --
it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly
address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see
your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and
self-righteous.


Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:

Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of
them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings
about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them
ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is
difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some
of these topics include the following:

1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con

2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of
    radar detectors.

3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.

4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why
    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue
    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)

5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's
    right to own and operate a radar detector

6)  `Buy American' discussions

7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates

8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible

9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?
      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the
          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.
          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]

Aside from the fact that i disagree w/ you, she did offer to resign and the

Hi sci.med folks...

I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium.

I have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex-wife.  She has been having
difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin, Tofranil, and now
wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion.  I would like to 
know whatever is important that I should know.  I worry about this sort of
thing and would like pros/cons regarding Lithium therapy.

I have a booklet from the "Lithium Information Center" based at the 
University of Wisconsin, but feel that it is pro-lithium and would be
interested in comments from the "not necessarily PRO" side of the fence.

I am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed...

Thanks for any information you can provide.

Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at,

I am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent

I need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best

In defense of the drivers, who are in the right lane.  Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  

Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  

BTW, If no one else is around, then GO FOR IT!.

Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.

Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?

If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  
As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more 
than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in 
the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is 
at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker?  

Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the 
light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape.

If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either
the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head
assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may
need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor
is out. 

If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for
repair.

Yes, but no more than he is worth. :-).  Seriously: Jerome is merely

tell us.  He is one in the community of saints.  You seem to wish for
a greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant

To be sure, Rome rejects (some significant aspects of) Protestant
thought just as vehemently as Protestants reject (some significant
aspects of) Roman thought.  Other than some peoplw who apparently try
to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, there
is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume.

Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans, as well as 
those between Rome and the Anglican communion (to which I belong) show
very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological
issues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity.
Thus, for example, as you go on to say:

Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as
opposed to political) significance.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it
won't.  You misread me if you think that my communion, at least, "throws
out" the deuterocanonical books.  Nor do I think you should overstress
the sense in which the more Reformed may do so.

>Again, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the

I seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here.  It verges on,
and could be taken as, anti-Semitic in the worst sense.  The "unbelieving"
Jews were, according to what I understand as a Christian, the chosen
people of God, and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation.
I think they have some say in the matter.  The Javneh meeting should not
be over-interpreted.  A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ (I don't
have more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily from
the background of Christian (rather than specifically Jewish) scholarship
suggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering
question, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis
of the scrolls that were kept in the Temple, and thereby "made the hands
unclean" when used.  The list of "sacred books" that may be drawn up from
Josephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book,
if I rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh.

All of this is not to "throw out" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way,
is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not? :-))
-- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment
does not do it justice.

Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something

Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  
I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science 
is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your 
contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed "scientific" 
can possibly know what's true and what's not.

Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees 
of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully 
controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the 
extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain 
treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even 
if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that
a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for
from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.
In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible
but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are
qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.

SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of 
evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  


I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a
mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and
occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much
of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as
informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years
now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to
just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of
the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for
the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the
NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from
subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of
scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the
*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific
investigation.

Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  "If this
hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical
research then it can't be of any interest to us."  

To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "There've got to
be controlled studies" position is an NLP technique called the Fast
Phobia/Trauma Cure.

Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most 
important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that 
it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell 
when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple 
visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that
it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is
useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially
a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral
therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once
(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The
process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to
practice it over again at home.

Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. 
(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  
Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up 
to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 
minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to 
the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a 
few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term 
follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view 
even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, 
there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best 
of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed 
after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done
with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast 
Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th
floor of my building and having a large balcony.)  

The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to
make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study
will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, 
many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill 
afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because 
the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the
scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain 
from scientific acceptance.) 

The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical 
psychology establishment is still saying "We don't have any way of 
knowing that it's effective."  

These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate 
as anyone could want, of course, but they say  "Why should I prove your 
theory?"  and  "The burden of proof is on the one making the claim."  
One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely 
unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't 
been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of 
books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much 
detail as I'm capable of.)  

Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with 
favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a
doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.

To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  
This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about "doctrinnaire" 
attitudes about science.  

Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  
If so, I apologize.

Yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic
cult (although not the only one.)  It had many elements that seem
to have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the
sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)

For quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:

The Covenant of the Flame
by David Morrell.

It has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing.
I won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but I will say that it
is relevant to Mithraism.

I'm quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said "once

Very interested indeed! This is against this kind of "changes" that the GNU

Anyway, at SIMULOG, we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide-

 I think you can do this with REGEDIT, which can make changes

OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the "Red Jays" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that "had Morris
performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off."

  And in Russia, capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the
black market. And in the US, capitalist minded types are imprisoned and killed
for things such as selling drugs, guns, pornography, and other victimless
activities.  It doesn't matter whether you are socialist or capitalist,
power and control are central to government. Since citizens can't be trusted to
run their own affairs, the government must watch them.  (for their
own good of course. I mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp!>

that cannot be allowed!)

  Not very surprising to anyone who believes in "hands off" government. If
you believe that your private life (both social and financial) are none of
anyone else's business, the difference between socialism and communism is
like the difference between murder by lethal injection or by
chainsaw. The more centralized the economy is, the more potential
abuses for accumulation of information on individuals. If you think
credit companies are bad, ...  Well, I'm sure a democratic socialist society
would vote for absolute privacy of all citizens -- NOT!

Well, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They
make reference to several scandals that occurred long before "the night of the
long knives". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of
the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name
escapes me at the moment) called "Homosexuals in History" asserts that Roehm
and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.

>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,
>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and
>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. 

Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,
look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not
have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of
documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the "knight of the
long knives" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping
together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's
homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've 
read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. 

>(Irving, a
>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance
>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)

I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do
you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have
read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that 
all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about 
homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they 
would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?
I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one 
should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. 

>I challenge anyone to document this claim.

If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),
then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where
the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to
archival material - most people on the net are not.

>I *have* found a great
>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the
>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,
>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.

Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so
that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis
might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is
true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?

I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were
homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious
for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German
govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends
were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long
tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -
back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a 
product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the
English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,
would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.

In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The
Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various 
pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote 
homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So 
it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, 
regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality.
Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all 
societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.

No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you
will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access 
to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern
homosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is
stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove
otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now.
SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives
(ESDI,RLL,IDE,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers
to get it to work with odd environments.

For information purposes, I had:

ST-01 Card + ST296N drive and a MAXTOR 212a drive with generic IDE
controller running together. I have also had the same SCSI setup work
in combination with a RLL drive, the ST251-1 drive.

Hi! Everyone,

Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from

from its offset. For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find
the original ellipse analytically?

I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,
but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear
programming technique to deal with this problem approximately.

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Please post here, let the others

I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.

No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing
so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up.

The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.

The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
my belly button.

       Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?

       I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw 
       a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation 
       was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.
       I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out
       like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping
       out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).

       I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.

For them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much
as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully
understanding the cause.  Many years ago, I was accidentally exposed
to a tiny dose of tear gas.  (It was in Athens, on the street leading
to the American Embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up
with tear-gas; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the
next day.)  Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.,
the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling
to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified and
wondered what disease or other health problem I had.  (I didn't find
out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.)  I can imagine
how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children:
suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of
control of your body---and not knowing the cause.

``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''  Yeah, right.

I said that I PERSONALLY had other people order the EXACT SAME FOOD at
TWO DIFFERENT TIMES from the SAME RESTAURANT and the people that
ordered the food for me did NOT TELL ME which time the MSG was in the
food and which time it was not in the food.

ONE TIME I HAD A REACTION

ONE TIME I DID NOT

THE REACTION CAME THE TIME THE MSG WAS IN THE FOOD

THAT WAS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

SAME RESTAURANT - SAME INGREDIENTS!!!

>Why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't
>normally consume, one of which happens to be MSG, do they immediately
>conclude that any negative reaction is to the MSG? 

I eat lots of Chinese food - I LOVE Chinese food.  I've just learned
the following

IF I get food at one of the restaurants that DOES NOT USE MSG or

IF I prepare the food myself without MSG or 

IF I order the food from a restaurant that will hold the MSG (and I
never get soup unless it's from a restaurant that cooks without the
MSG)

I DO NOT GET A REACTION!!!!

OKAY

DO YOU UNDERSTAND!!!!

I GET A REACTION FROM MSG

I DO NOT GET A REACTION WHEN THERE IS NO MSG

If you're having trouble understand this, please tell me which of the
words you do not understand and I'll look them up in the dictionary
for you.

Just to make sure everyone is clear on this: "it never has" refers to 
"protects", not "fails to protect"; i.e., in my lifetime I have never seen 
the U.S. government consistently protect the interest of U.S. citizens,

I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper

about this, and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once (at
the initial link establishment). I figure that I can do this with
DES and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Is using a Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish a 64 bit DES key
acceptable, in other words, what are the pro's and con's of such a 
setup? Are there any important issues to watch out for (aside from
filtering out unacceptable keys)?

And in order to achieve this, I guess I will need to use 64bit math

To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16sec occur.
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can "hiccup" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
pay attention to the errors coming back.

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus
error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and
nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.


My question is:

	Is there a good relay/relay circuit that I can use for switching
audio, so that there will be *NO* noise of any kind on the audio lines.


I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also, exact part

If you were to start your own religion, this would be fine.  But there
is no scriptural basis for your statement, in fact it really gets to
the heart of the problem.  You think you know more than scripture.
Your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the Word of God.  Just

the churches you want and it won't change the fact that it is wrong.
That is not to imply that gays don't deserve the same love and

just because they are nice people is baseless, and it offers Satan a
perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing.

I am sure you didn't miss the implication that we could have another
Richard Nixon type president in the future (perhaps not too distant
future, acutally).  With that in mind, then I take it you also would
not object to the Gov coming up with a decision (not proposal - just
like Clinton Cripple is a decision, not a proposal) sprung on us to
start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house,
which could be activated without your knowlege.  They would be well
concealed so you wouldn't know the location, to prevent you from covering
the lens opening.  After all, nothing you're doing would be of the
slightest interest to a government official, right?  So, you surely
should not object to such a proposal...

Not the best anology, but the principle is pretty close - the ability
to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort, without your
knowlege, protected by entirely by "government safeguards".  You can
still draw your curtains, so you can still have your privacy from everyone
else (except Big Brother)!!  After all we need this for protection from
drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals (like 'enemies of the
STATE')... and you don't really have a right to "unbreakable" privacy
anyway, sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION
puts it...

I find it curious they use the word "unbreakable" when the term really
should be "difficult to break without proper authorization" (which the
Government most certainly has at their disposal, right?  They wouldn't
want to be able to break it ILLEGALLY, would they?)...  Nawww, not
"for the People" Clinton....

Can you, while my mind is on it, give us one good reason that the
algorithm should be a secret algorithm, unless this encryption scheme
either is a joke, or contains features like a 'master key' or other back
door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping? If it was really even moderately
secure, and the government really meant to require the proper court
order and the keys that are in the Escrow accounts to be able to decipher
the traffic, what is the need to keep the algorithm secret?  Seems I
hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm
to remain a secret to be effective, it is not a worthwhile scheme... is
this just idle talk, or is the Administration bullshitting everyone?

With GREAT skepticism, and many doubts on our Administrations intentions...

And WAIT!! We haven't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in
mind for e-mail and datafile security.  The press release does say that
this is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged
citizens.  Perhaps 'subjects' would be the better term - 'citizens'
somehow does not seem appropriate... that implies a free people, 'subjects'
better fits a population who serve at the pleasure of their rulers.
One thing for certain:  The government no longer regards the citizens
as their bosses anymore, but the other way around...

If you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will 
generally find yourself in one of two camps: 

   (1) Faith + Works --> Salvation
or (2) Faith --> Salvation + Works

Either (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will 
inevitably result in good works. 

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on
Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when 
read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of 
justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring
the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word). 
Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being 
"justified" or "proven" by the display of good works. Also according 
to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a "dead" or 
"useless" faith which fails to save.

James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it
is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward 
salvation, but as evidence of true faith. 

Regards,

I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about 
fighting my ticket.

Many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your 
case in court.  Others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge 
about the circumstances surrounding your ticket, while one fellow lost
because the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such foolishness.

Several of you suggested that I obtain a book called "Fight Your Ticket".

The general theme from those who said "go for it", was to be prepared.  
I should do as much research as possible, go back and review the scene, 
transcribe what happened to tape or paper, use any witnesses that may 
have been around, have a list of questions to ask the cop and/or the judge,
and to be positive and assertive.  I am innocent until proven guilty! <gulp>

A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed, as this might 
trip up the arresting officer, he may not show up if the date is on his day
off or if he feels/knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you.

One individual stated that an Officer could be an Expert Witness, and if he
says I was speeding, then by damn, I was speeding.

Another says that I must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun.

Lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all.  I'll let you know what
happens after the big day!

I don't really mind the length of games either.  If they want to speed
the games up in sensible ways, that's fine with me too.  However, what
I object to is the assertion by baseball people (Whitey Herzog, Buck
Rodgers are who I've heard say this) that games are too long because
hitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to
be expanded.

                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April 30, 1993
                              11:30 AM PDT

DSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29)
at approximately 6:00 AM.  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34
meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM
yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days.

As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial
Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to
command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.

Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency
Mode entry.  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape
Recorders 2 and 3.  Playback of DTRs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completed
yesterday, was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight
Sequence C9 execution.  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart
C9 to complete data playback.  Present planning is to perform playbacks
between  as soon as Wednesday, or as late as Friday of next week (5/5-
5/7), dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity.  DTR playback will
be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second.  Upon
verification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will be maintained at
the 4K S & E rate.

Can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medications 
has been linked to rapid/excessive weight gain and/or a distorted 
sense of taste or smell:  Hismanal; Azmacort (a topical steroid to 
prevent asthma); Vancenase.

Also:
You may have guessed, I'm an allergy sufferer--but I'm beginning to 
suspect I'm also the victim of a Dr. toliberal with the prescription 
p. The allergist I went to last Oct. simply inquired about my symptons 
( I was suffering chronic asthma attacks), gave me a battery of 
allergy tests, and went down a checklist of drugs (a photocopied 
sheet).  I've gained out 30 lbs. since then though I haven't eaten 
more or much differently than before; I'vsuffered depression; , 
fatigue; and I've experienced a foul smell and sense of taste for 
about the last two months.  I mentioned the lack of smell and taste to 
this Dr. in Feb. and he said my sinuses did look a bit swollen (he 
just looked up my nose with his little light--the same one used for 
ears), and prescribed Prednisone and Sulfatrim DS (severe headaches 
and a rash resulted, particularly after my week's worth of Prednisone 
ran out).  Now he wants to do a rhinoscopy to see if I have a bleeding 
ulcer or polyps in my sinus cavities.  I'm considering seeing another 
doctor.  Any suggestions/advice?  I'd really appreciate it!

Subject: Marian Apparitions #1
Organization: Ft. Lauderdale, FL
Lines: 56

The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure, a nun of the
sisters of Charity on July 18, 1830 at Rue du Bac, Paris.

Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5
or 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light. 
The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised
the Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her. Our Lady appeared to
her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining
to her life and to the future of France and the world.

On November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructed
her to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this 
medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would
receive great graces. In less than a year there were three more
apparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports
were received by those who wore it. Within two years of its issuing
the medal was known as the "Miraculous Medal". Catherine died in 1876.
Her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). She was
canonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at the
motherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with
Our Lady.

The apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed
in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor.
Above the altar, a pyramid painted to represent God's all knowing
wisdom looked down on them. Our Lady's feet rested on a white globe
and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was
stepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world.
Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed 
Catherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in
piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword
represented her suffering with Jesus.

The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned
that a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition 
leading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets.
And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute
with the forces of the dark. She told Catherine "The times are
evil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will be
overturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of all
kinds."

Refer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages.
A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores.

I will post other Marian events every few days or so including
the ones happening today which are still under investigation.
These postings serve only to introduce you to these events.
Please look more into them and understand the reason for 
the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions.

If that's the ONLY reason, I'd be inclined to doubt whether or not what
they profess is Christianity.  The relationship of faith is based upon
trust.  Fear and trust are generally incompatible.  If my only motivation
is fear, is there room for trust?  If so, there's room for faith.  
If fear precludes trust, then there can't be faith.

Yes this may be true in the case of the SCIENCE data coming from the spacecraft
and other stuff about the operations.  However, there is still stuff regarding
regular operation that belongs to the company and they have ever legal right
to keeping it theirs.  But this does not mean that everything can or

 I just thought I would pass along my experience with APS. I recently ordered
 an external Quantum 240. The salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable, the
 order came when promised, and the invoice was at the price quoted. 

 Installing the drive was simple; I didn't even have to read the manual. The
 SCSI address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. I daisy-chained the drive
 from my Syquest (also from APS) and booted up with no problems. 

 I'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. It's a
 pretty good assortment.

 The drive/fan is a bit noisier than I would like, but I think it'll be OK.
 The speed seems very good, although I haven't run any objective tests. It
 also seems to spin up pretty quickly; I can hit the power switch for it, and
 almost immediately power the Mac without any problems booting from the drive.

 Some observations: the case is plastic (good quality, though) while my older
 Syquest case is metal. There is one LED, which is normally green, and
 flickers red as the drive is accessed.

 Just a data point,
 Rich

Oh, yea, and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER.  One over the minimum, two
bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches.  I listened
to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a
real treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is
better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me).

But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have 
been a different story :-)

Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in
Major League baseball ....  Pretty impressive in any league.

Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a 
really interesting team to follow this year.  Also, John Cummings (rookie)
has had three solid outings with no support.  If Fleming comes back 
this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year
(relief is another story, though - grimace).

Too cool.  The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from 
start to end.  And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of award
for the way he called the game.  The guy is truly a joy to listen to --
he deserves a pennant race ...

Although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it's an old canard in the space
business called "trolling for billionaires"), there is a good chance that a
much smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd Congress. This is the
Back to the Moon bill, put together by the people who passed the Launch
Services Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to develop
lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding.
There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million.
 
Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably
worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the Delta
Clipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million). We have a
clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed to
simply wishing for our dreams to come true. Please support the Back to the
Moon bill.

Has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so, what have you

One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from
other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. From then on other
workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf 
again. 

The workstation is set up to share its discs etc. The machine
is a 486DX/33, 8MB RAM, with Diamond Stealth video.  It behaves this
way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters, including a SMC Elite.
It also behaves the same way if I use the Windows VGA driver, rather

That was what I got from your phrasing, too.  Well, then, were they (the ones

That is the recommended way to practice with a CCW, too.  Aim alone is no good  
for defense, if you can't get the gun rapidly.

Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights
violations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights
violations.

Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab
States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can
claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.

I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of
peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life.
I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to
it. Peace AND justice. 

If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present
his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully 
entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has
a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they
wish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the
Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since
Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations
quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a
legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. 

Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor
are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.
Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be
implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. 

Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first
party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and
the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some
symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise
the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people
and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own
past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to
acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal
of most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.

When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages
destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock. 
I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the
meaning of such massive destruction and destitution.

According to CNN last night (Saturday 4/24/93) he has now found bullets
in two of the corpses, in the head (that would indicate that the bullets
were aimed at killing the humans).

Check out #27903, just some 20 posts before your own. Maybe you missed
it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters
they have substantial knowledge of.

For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown
off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food,
packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects. 
Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his*
sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.

Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup.

One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose. Next time you power down the computer, check that all cables are on tight.

        But that's just the problem. There is no such thing as
        "MIME-Formatted". By analogy, MIME is a content-labelling
        standard for the box, not a specification for the contents
        themselves. It provides a standard for "like-minded"

I know how to set the jumpers on the 40M to be slave and the settings

CMOS settings and fdisk. The problem is: what letter will the CMOS
give the new drive? If it's D:, what will happen when Stacker creates
D: and swap? Can I tell CMOS to make it E:? So that if I Stack it, I
will have C, D, E and F?

Just for reference, here's the earlier quote:
Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9
and Deuteronomy 22:20-25:

: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And
: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew
: and Gentile alike.

These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the
other is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on
an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change
was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus
change that?

: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the
: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.

Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning
non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to
deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?

I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible
from end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this
knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and
back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David
Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if
they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly
made the means look frightening.

However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but
believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far
more of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy
to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough
to debate with these people.

: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's
: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.

No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told
me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will
by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to
obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to
two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it
with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing
the will of God.

: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is
: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about
eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from
the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.

Seems he didn't understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic

Sigh, it seems religion makes your mind/brain filter out anything
that does not fit into your personal scheme. 

So anyone that thinks the possibilities with Jesus is bound to the
classical Lewis notion of 'liar, lunatic or saint' is indeed bound

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!

V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.

Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two. 

How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at
130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1Mb/s.

[ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]

Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!

As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In
my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90
or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs
outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in
junkyards.

I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the
Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least
standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.

Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as
far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than
the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred
to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things
you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more
professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars
running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.

You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal

autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers
foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground
on the identical car in front of you!

>have no respect for their own lives.

If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much
over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much
safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic
because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading
a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.

There is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of <93 probes.
Complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals.  It is
a known problem, present on most (if not all) pre-93 Probes, so you 
shouldn't have to pay them to fix it.  In my case, they fixed it on
my extended warranty (I just had to pay a $50 deductable) (the
work was valued at something like $185 with labor and parts).  Having
removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions, I think their estimate
was fair.

    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment
of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to
both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike
Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the 
big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance
He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he 
had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  
  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:
Morning show:
  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, 
and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti
had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries
to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of
sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he
interjects humor and politics into his show.
10 AM to 12 Noon:
  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their
abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the
advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller
who is asking about who the local team is going to draft
in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get
better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that
they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless
it was a major story.
  I would consider this even because they are two different
styles of host.

12 Noon to 2 PM:
  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to 
Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been
on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability
to transcend the "homer" mentality of the Philadelphia fan
base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia 
spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.
Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0
score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')
I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight
and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating
hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on 
either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and
you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.

2PM to 4PM:
  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and 
Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided
in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,
but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10
to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do
get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so
it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the
appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which
are often hilarious.  

4 PM to 7 PM:
  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like
Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  
I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he
was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly
homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there
is a game on that night, but you will see later for the 
reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.

7 PM to Midnight:
  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes
Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on
charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my
nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go
nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)
On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets
Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the
west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course
I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but
WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.
(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the
IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))
During the summer, it
is all talk on WIP.


Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with
the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and
12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

RISC used to mean "Reduced Instruction Set Computer", true.  They
still use the same acronym, but only to be familiar.  What RISC really
means is a recently-designed CPU.  :-)

In general, most RISC CPUs are like this:

    A large number (32 or more) of general-purpose registers
    A fixed instruction size, usually 32 bits
    An instruction may make only one memory reference
    Memory references must be aligned
    There are delayed branches (branch after the next instruction) or
a target prediction bit (probably will/won't branch)
    Instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction
stream

  The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode,
which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800
does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should
be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s),
since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell
for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with
the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.
Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using
standard palette.

  BTW if anyone is insterested, I'm trying to sell a Diamond Viper (2 megs
vram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (I'm too broke to
take it myself).

>Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?

  I think it's available in limited quantites.  No idea of what VGA
chip it uses though.

  Be very careful with OEM P9000 boards though, the Orchid I got
for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as 
documentation, and conflicts the hell with my VLB controller 
card (or maybe it's my motherboard, an A.I.R. 486 VLB)

Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US
Government? 
Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you?
The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will
stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you? 

Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great
beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is
not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church 
stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation
and made it all null and void.. 

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what
ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..
Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason
or another, but who will give you a "home".. Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever..
There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and
offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..
Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.
The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will
not care.. 
If your worried about the US, do the same thing..

Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many
other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what
ever..
Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a
little bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to
piss off.. If my ancestors thought the way many today think, Id have been born
in Central Europe just north of the Black Sea..

Which means he has absolutely no idea about what the Assumption is.

However greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no
way God or even part of God or equal to God.  The Assumption of our
Blessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the
redemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not
ASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along
with Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in
Heaven.  Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to
any of the previously mentioned personages.

Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology.

I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list.  But we have
strayed from the original topic.  Our computer environment is pretty split
between Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But
there are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users
here.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter
which AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there
is no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been 
inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity
in a DOS program to selectively transport the files.

The question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into
windows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is 
in a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite
clear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies.

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt).

You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this
is the hard part).  Then, in the callback that starts the drawing,
you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. 
Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean...
TRUE when you are finished, and FALSE when you want to keep
processing.  If you return FALSE, the workProc is automatically
re-installed.  

Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop, since
events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you
are using the same Ada bindings I am, however, you are hosed, and
should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt).

Steve I'm glad to see that you abandoned the preamble thing.  What; did
you do a word search to find Welfare somewhere else in the constitution?

[my comments and paraphrases in brackets]

Article I Section 8:  [in some ways the guts of the constitution]

The Congress shall have the Power:

1. To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, 
       to pay the Debts [indebtedness as defined in the document]
       and provide for the common Defence [Defence as precisely defined]
       and general Welfare [as defined through the document, mostly in ways
                           [that limit the government.]
         of the United States; [but the above taxes shall be uniform through-
                               [out the U.S.]

    [so far the congress has been given the power to collect taxes uniformly]

    [ then ... ]

2.  To borrow Money [...]
3.  To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, [interstate and Indian tribes]
4.  To [do uniform Naturalization and Bankruptcies]
5.  To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and [etc.]
6.  To [punish counterfeiters]
7.  To establish Post Offices and post Roads
8.  To [provide patents and copyrights]
9.  To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;
10. To define and punish Piracies and [etc.]
11. To declare War, [and etc.]
12. To raise and support Armies,[but for no longer than two years at a stretch]
13. To provide and maintain a Navy, [notice no time limit on this one]
14. To [make the rules for the army and navy]
15. To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws [etc.]
16. To provide for [training of the army except for some state stuff]
17. To exercise exclusive Legislation [in D.C]
18. To make all Laws [necessary to execute the foregoing "Powers"].

Your original instinct was right.  Looking to other nations for precedents
that support an expansive liberal agenda is much easier than looking to the
slim pickins found in the constitution.

This was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived
immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son
Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a
stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of
hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on
his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.
 It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and
thus he became the "Elevator of the heavens."  This "god" made men able to
"feel" as if heaven were afar off and "as if either the God of Heaven could not
see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of
His laws."  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled "Emancipator"
or "Deliverer"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system
and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many
benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a
Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other
actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it
as true.

>The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is

I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to
the coming "Anointed One" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who
was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the
Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the
dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it
as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation
via faith and nothing else.

>It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The

I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it
because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the
eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal
life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of
consciousness.  

>It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous

It depends upon your def of "lost."  The elect were lost only in time as
outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. 
Existentially we were all born "lost", but the "righteous" were "in Christ" and
therefore never *assuredly* lost.

Ah!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I

Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very

 >The similarity in the midst of great variety of

Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the
underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as "mystery" religions
for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private
side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they
revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings
to light. The "Mystery of Iniquity" that we find in the Bible, correlates to
this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,
little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would
not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point
today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in
Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the "husband son.")

No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the
church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their
worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you
are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to
expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which
they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and
discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also
the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's "Egyptians."  He really
does a number on what the Greeks did to what they "pilfered" from the
Egyptians.

Each age has its own focus of theology.  The early church struggled with the
Trinitarian formulation.  The reformation dealt with authority.  Today,
eschatology has had much study.  The early creeds do not spell these things out
in detail because, 1) they weren't the topic of concern, 2) there was
insufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn't have the exegetical tools that
we have today.  Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  One
age has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is
given growth.  It would be natural for the end of times to have the garden
appropriate for the growth of eschatology, wouldn't it?

------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------

I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course included
cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external
reading too).

William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of
"evil" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,
University of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what
would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,
and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think
the books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced
..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I
think they're onto something.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
		How cult psychology works...
	[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]

So long as Koresh could "own" his people, he made sure they didn't
believe there was any life out there for them, away from him.
Otherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians
recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived
only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.
Absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they
believed him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even
the Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left
him, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces
of the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)
couldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die
too, like the folks in Jonestown.

For a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife
(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then
themselves.  That's the consequence of shattered "cultism."  It really
does happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such
cases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no
matter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]

made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.
Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He
held them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing
would really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!

Look at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,
at the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once
Jonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his
entourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd
be busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought
up by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are
tapes...  The "logic" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it
wouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people
who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by
THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the
same with the Branch Davidians.
(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER
WHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)

...
The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate
reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying
full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the
off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...

So, the only way the BATF/FBI could "save" those people, and future
cults, is by ignoring such signs.

I suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him
into letting them go, or somehow influencing "his" people to abandon
him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.
... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that
with blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe
they're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's
certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.

...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]

    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from
Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.

    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd
want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning
boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_
playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at
checkmate time people really die, and I could be blamed.

...

I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you
deny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and
the rest of the gummint should exist at all.

hi all, i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i
shoulda went into more detail... Being my anxiety level is peaking and you
folks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what
you people think regarding my previous post.
To recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were MD and 4 DO.

as it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 MD and 2 DO), the
results of which are 2 waiting lists (1 MD and one DO)

3 schools i heard nothing from at all.

I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no
info whatsoever to tell me.

I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles
and a few "safety"  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first
to reject me)

my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR
I couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art
history, politics etc 

Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work
for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.

I cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. What
percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average?
I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm
acceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the
mailbox anxiety?  

If you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments
for me feel free to send them down... Typing is a form of anti-anxiety
thereapy hehehehe :)

	Two thoughts.

	- I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next 
generation to accept genetic manipulation.  It seems that people frown
upon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that.
Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation
we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'.

	- Most interesting human traits will probably be massively
polygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive
social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't
be the advantage it's made out to be.  Some people will certainly pursue it
as if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out.

Yes, they are nice ads, and even better: great prices.  But this is all on

Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never
be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no
materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low
grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, 
and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat 
sink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military
weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space 
travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as 
Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor 
activity in the global scope of things.

Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent
calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's
too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories
that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna
has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital
sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers
a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,
and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and
heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity
wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.

We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually
ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to
deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more
expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the
easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few
centuries, if not much longer.

Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio
astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site
of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for
defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is
unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.
The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good
enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for
conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a
bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little
ultimate profit either.

Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights. We are now in the time of
Civil Rights. Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings
attached they choose as the Grantor of said rights. And if that means that 
verdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or

While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda, Shomron, v'Chevel-Azza,
in order to create jobs for their residents, I find it deplorable that
this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration
since 1967, *with regard to their Jewish residents*. Past governments
found funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the
requisite infrastructure, but where was the investment for creating
industry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)? 

After 26 years, Yehuda and Shomron remain barren, bereft of even 
middle-sized industries, and the Jewish settlements are sterile
"bedroom communities", havens for (in the main) Israelis (both
secular *and* religious) who work in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem but
cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs.

There's an old saying: "bli giboosh, ayn kivoosh" -- just living there
wasn't enough, we had to *really* settle it. But instead, we "settled"
for Potemkin villages, and now we are paying the price (and doing
for others what we should have done for ourselves).

As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the
"innovations" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return
to the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.

I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in
the Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just
instituted the "Tenebrae" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for 
a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things
that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those "facts" were
always there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about
the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over
breakfast Easter Sunday.

My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music
and worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee
but listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong
hand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong
as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional
reason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual
guidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA "wishy-washy".
 
As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-
regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes
the true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a
traditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament
of PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.
The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings
are not shared by everyone.

I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want 
them attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful
service during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of
Worship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such
as the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it
is Not there.

Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and "fit in".
My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils
would intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who
have beared with me this far understand what I mean.

Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not
to worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something
wrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or
pastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to 
provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with
the Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change
faiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and
ministers.

In Christ,

sounds like you are an atheist by nature, then.  or is it possible

Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see
xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 
So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 
So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood
etc.
Now you are saying:

>We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,

If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the
discussion a *lot* easier.

Yes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.

No I don't think so actually. 

You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),
manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these
changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual
colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?

Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!

I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.

What are you saying
???

Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8
bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are
saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those
parts of the program that cause the problem!!

Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an
approach clumsy, however.

Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem
to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one
through.

>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
>designed for that.

As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of
saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what
the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.

>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; 

Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,
having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow
reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made
to the 8 bit image palette.

Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?

>say,
>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
>expected that the image still is the same. 

Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main
control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit
image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit
file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.

>So, XV were designed
>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
>program work -- design error.

Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)

Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets
you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the
human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it
was designed for. It makes no false claims.

>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
>major change to the original design.

If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of
precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So 
far, you have not done so.

>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it
if it is so easy.

Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.

I think this is a bit of an exageration.

What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in
the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else
had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...

Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly

some more.

I'm sure all of you have heard of the extraordiary start by  rookie
J.T. Snow of the California Angeles.  Other than the fact that his
father was a star receiver with the L.A. Rams and is now a radio
personality in Los Angeles and J.T. came from the Yankees organization
I don't know much about J.T.  If anyone has info and background on 
the young fenom....please post.

By the way, for those of you not following his exploits he has hit
four home runs in three days.  Two last night.  He has also delivered
the winning hit a couple of times for the Angeles in this young season.

Thanks...

In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a
court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal
wiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the
system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?

The second section shows the sequence of events.
The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the
line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope
with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are
talking analogue telephony here).
What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?
Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?
I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some
intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course
in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the
digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the
same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not
be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later
it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units
(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.

How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed
for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone
line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised
speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to
add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.

This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect
anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body
called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,
that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know
if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.
Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get
to fish in the escrowed key pool as well.

You might try the recorder and make a micro.  I done that to do certain operations 
in a windows app that didn't have the ability to use a micro.  It should be in the 
Accessories window.  The only problem is that it has to be runing for it to work.

Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my
Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few
changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5.
(The card is revision 5A)

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part
of the ISA bus.

The question I have is simple:
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X,
what does the manual claim that this jumper does?

To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the
BALE line?

On a related note:
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name
chart, but that is it.

3.  Don't post mindless `woofs,' or `anti-woofs,' e.g. "The

This drive is less than one year old.  The cartridges have all been bought
since then.  All is in excellent condition and still under warranty.
Due to a change in system use, I now need a large, contiguous drive.

Offer includes:
	SyDos 44i internal drive
	SCSI adapter card and cables
	All original documentation
	Software
	All original packaging
	8 cartridges totalling over 350Mb (no bad sectors or defects)

The installation was a breeze on my 386 clone.

I will trade for something near 300Mb IDE, or sell for $450.
I will also consider trading for 4 4Mx9 30 pin SIMMs at 70ns.

What I like about GUI's:

	- The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files,
	  text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way
	  such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...

	- The ability to have several applications / screens visible
	  and accessable at the same time.

	- Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and
	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with
	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally
	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.
	  If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do
	  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is
	  a long and painful experience.


What I hate about GUI's:

	- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess
	  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a
	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something
	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my
	  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be
	  done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,
	  searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I
	  need to use both hands for is entering text.

	I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons
	or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.

Well, here goes.

The first item of business is to establish the importance space life
sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared
to football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested
or even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can
make a major change in that lack of insight and education.

All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document
which can be released to the general public around the world.  The
document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long
term human habitation in space.

I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to 
succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld
(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering,
chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created
to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.

So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective
methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies
which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed
literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates
and clearly important to existing space programs.

In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into
various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.
This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the
basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet,
and any other source!

I'm eager to hear your comments and see posts on this thread.

To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written,
there is evidence of love, but that is a cultural bias. This is
a poor answer which you needn't rebut.

I will now pull the old bait and switch.

I think you should use the Bible to judge man, not God.
By that I mean, if your moral intuition doesn't like what
is described in the Bible, realize that such things are going on
now. I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil
and ask what are you doing to fight it? Not you specifically,
but everyone, including myself. If I don't like the genocide
in the Bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now?
To move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many people
right now are suffering. If you think hell isn't fair and are
willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence,
what about how life isn't fair? Right now there is a young mother
with three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through
the day. Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie.
Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to
fix his TV. Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don't
we help them. I think you are correct to challenge any Christian
who doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess.

You want evidence of God. Find someone who is making a difference,
someone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times
and has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask 
the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the 
woman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful
business woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound
baby. They won't all be Christians, or even what you might
call religious, but there will be something in common.

God is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what is
in those people's hearts. It doesn't matter if you can't give
intellectual assent to any description you've heard, they're
all wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart 
is a step in the right direction. Follow that instead.
Then come back and read the Bible and you'll see that same
thing described there.

called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the
old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below,
main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents
the interface to the library function.

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top)
{
        Widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars
        XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class
        int junk = 0;
        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,
                                        NULL);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        topone,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(topone);
        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when "Exit" button clicked
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }
        XtDestroyWidget(box);
        XtCloseDisplay(dis);
}

// SetItUp - should be called once only
void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top)
{
        int junk = 0;
        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);
}

// doit - some library function callable from the outside
void doit()
{
        static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called
        static Widget top;

        static int setup = 0;

        if (!setup)
        {
                SetItUp(&app, &top);
                setup = 1;
        }
        bla(app, top);
}

// main - program which links to my library
main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
        {
                doit();
                printf("sleeping...\n");//widget still on screen at this point
                sleep(5);
        }
}


The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.
(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the "sleep" in the main prog,
despite the XtDestroyWidget call).

Anyone see something I'm missing?

Thanks very much.

This isn't exactly audio, but take a look in "RF Design" magazine,
April 93, for the article "A Robust Signaling Technique for Part 15
RF Control Netowrk Applications."  Page 29.  Sources of parts are
mentioned; in the same issue is an article that features a chipset

I don't know how many hours you've spent on this, but the Sun User
Group makes X11R5 available on CD-ROM to its members. The 1992.1 disk
has both sources and binaries and it sells for $50.  I've tagged a
table of contents and an orderform on below if anyone's interested.

SUG CD 1992.1 is X11R5 and GNU on a CDROM, priced at $50 to SUG
members, including a caddy!

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk
contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,
almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net
postings, priced at only $250.

Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added
as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk
set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second
available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks.

The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains
a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members (and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per
disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a
SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live
within the US or $55 outside.

The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used
by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a
total of 543MB of material, including:

X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after
the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0
distribution are included (109MB of material).  Binaries for: X Xsun

COPIES OF CONTRIBUTED X SOURCES (from export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib),
which were then uncompressed/untarred into source directories (212MB).
These are sources only, and some of them were (after the date of
production of this disk) included in the MIT contrib-2 and contrib-3
distributions.

Subject: Mix GL with X (Xlib,Xt,mwm)
Organization: The Internet

NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu


I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application
could be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an 
XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of
the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe).

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program?
Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
with XOpenWindow?

I have never used GL before, but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first
time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also, most of
the GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this
initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this
true?

Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?


Environment:
     AIXwindows X11R4
     Motif 1.1
     GL is available
     AIX Sys V 3.2
     IBM RS/6000 360

Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I 
ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, 
which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 
miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put 
together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 
cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but 
considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a 
shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next 
year (according to a WSJ article).
 
Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in 
Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 
1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described 
it as a "seriously handsome car with broad shoulders," I thought 
it looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a 
Toyota Celica (yuch!).  Description of mechanicals same as has 
been reported from the PM article.

Sjogren's syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as well
as induce primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise the abdominal swelling could be
due to a complication of Sjogren's known as pseudolymphoma which *can* produce
a splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). She should definitely see a rheumatologist.

Since you don't mention skin disorder, anemia, or joint pain you'd probably
rule out erythema nodosum or scleroderma.

You'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO--the Taurus
is a front-wheel-drive vehicle...

I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker
than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg
disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway. 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all "performance-type" cars (like the 5.0l
Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans,
but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO.

The problem is that this will also cause  "a certain amount of interference"
in *all* systems within the range of the device.  A long time ago I built a
small jammer to dissuade my brother from using his radio alarm clock at 
something like 4am, which had just enough range to cover my room and his.
However something powerful enough to mask all (or at least most) emissions from
your computer equipment is also going to knock out half your neighbourhoods
radio and TV reception.  This isn't going to make you many friends.

Incidentally, an older-model TRS80 makes a fine wideband jammer <grin>

As far as I can see, no matter how the session keys are generated (be it
Diffie-Hellman or whatever), any Cripple conversation which travels in
whole or in part over a land-line is vulnerable to this scheme.  Law-
enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco, or illegally by finding
some part of the phone line that they can cut into.  The degree of risk
depends very much on location - not good in the middle of a busy street,
but not bad on a line in open country (leading to a drug lord's ranch).  The
only way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a public
key indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call (all
of them) - totally impractical, even if some part of the Cripple algorithm
could be used as a kind of public key (I don't understand enough about these
things to know).

This sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link,
and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for
other phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone.

Gosh, yet another way to get round Cripple encryption.  How many is that
we've found so far?  And that's without even knowing the details of the
algorithm.

I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my

the Wabi (Windows API Binary Interface...I think) technology that wil
run Windows apps straight outta da box.  If this flies in enhanced mode,
then here's another contender to look out for in the corporate/education
market.

Too big and complex for the home front...Windows 4/Mac Sys7 will take those
while Win4Wkgrps - NT - OS/2 will fight it out for the small-to-mid businesses.

However, once the PowerPC becomes available (especially in laptop/notebook form)
then these will migrate into all markets....the ability to connect up to a unix

attractive to alot of people!!!

Just my predictions.

Don't mount it on the side.  Call up Crown, the company that has the
patent on the PZM, and ask them for information on construction and
use of the things.  You may have to determine the correct spacing
emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the
design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of
the electret element to increase the high frequency response, and you
are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.

Crown has a nice book on the subject, though it's unfortunately rather
short on mathematics.  There's a JAES article from many years back, too.

Still, for your application, you'll be a lot better off buying the cheap
Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastoczny's modifications to get a
clean balanced output.  Phil's mods seem to get reposted here on a regular
basis.

  I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and 
  made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most
  evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of
  experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA
  resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.
  
  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It
  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the 
  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed
  a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.
  So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer
  one.

If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing
with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think
he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't
signed.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once;

My best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
pages under "Motorcycle Dealers") and ask for the address of the local
section BMW Owners Club.  The local BMW dealer will give you details
of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details.  Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can
afford it.  The warranty is fairly handy as BM bits are made from
solid gold, apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum.  Apparently.

Hello, Brycen ?!
I'm a Norwegian journalist student - and also a Christian. Thanks for your 
testimony! But I want to ask you one question: What do you think of Heavy 
Metal music after you became a Christian? You know there are Christian bands 
like Barren Cross, Whitecross, Bloodgood and Stryper, that play that kind of 
music. I like some of it, I feel like it sometimes. Of course I listen to 
the lyrics too. I don't listen to any Christian band, but it's better than 
listening to secular music anyway. 
Hope you're still going strong - with Christ!!

Israeli nationalism (also known as Zionism) is the nationalism of the
Jewish people.  The Jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all.

Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arab people.  Arabs have
been around for a long time.  They already  have some 2 dozen states,
large and small, covering 98% of the Middle East.

More specifically, Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arabs
from the region of Palestine, just as Egyptian nationalism is the
nationalism of Arabs from the region of Egypt.  One Palestinean state
already exists in what was once known as Palestine: - it is called
Jordan. 

There is no justification in carving out a second and tiny Palestinean
state out of the only Jewish state, itself very, very small, just as
there is no justification in carving out another American state out of
Mexico.

Mox nix.  The BD's were prepared to provide their own heat and light,
and were doing so for weeks while the power was out.  That means the
compound contained containers of flammable liquids or gases (that could
be busted by a tank intrusion), plus ignition sources, which no one can 
tell for sure were all off at the time.

On the contrary.  We are proposing alternate scenarios.  The people who
are coming to wild conclusions are the feds, who are absolutely positive
how the fire started, even though none of them were in a position to 
see it, either (and the stories they "hear" from their prisoners changes
hourly).

The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks
had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscripts/scrolls
and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated 
(perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions, or perhaps just
as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes

To avoid paperwork associated with re-certification as a brand new car,

still a Stanza.

Stop making statements about something you know nothing about, that is
gay people.  You make your sweeping generalizations with no grounding

And if you are typical then I can start extrapolating a lot of interesting

I don't see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the
battery.

However, you would have been better off leaving them outside. Keeping
them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside.
A warm battery will self-discharge faster than a cold one.

When you are storing a battery it's a good idea to charge it once a month.
Letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it (I suspect this is
what caused your problems).

Hello,

I already tried our national news group without success.

I tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PC
with a normal TEAC drive.
I already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shorted
pin 6 (5.25"/3.5" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins
8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.
The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD, but the FD's light
stays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk,
but I can't access it.
The TEAC works fine in a normal PC.

Are there any points I missed?

Thank you.

Charlie Brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use
the film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one.  Note, though, that
you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it
may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.

The things are easy to dismantle.  The key piece of information is that
when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the
film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when
the camera is made.  So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's
standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.

All the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables
is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,
and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in
another.  If you take it apart yourself, you get an AA alkaline battery
(still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and
pieces from the camera.

I expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really
determined.

We might get further if we begin by accepting that the government 
really couldn't be bothered less about the political opinions of the 
right wing pro establishment types. Just about the only circumstances 
in which I could think that they would be interested in their political 
views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give
the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the 
socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. 


Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which
the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force
lets try thinking.

In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as
a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush
was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook 
remember.

Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply "ask" their
chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be "nice"
boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the
chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.

Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the
same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know
this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and 
Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show 
trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialism
and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.
It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.

>JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?

This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understood
the trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,
at the same time, he is God's son "For God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten son". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could
he really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost "planted the seed" in Mary, so to speak,
then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the
human father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's 
qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try
and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that
case, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship
isn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God
incarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God
manifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone
who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? 

Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid
to redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would
rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing
how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body
may have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical
pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.
The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much
meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only
one was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very
offensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my
sincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.
But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.
 
[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.
First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this
group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You
seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense,
with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that
terrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin
Birth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn't
imply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means
the only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material.

Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a
Trinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is
a part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth.
Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn't
specifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Son
who was incarnated.

This sounds suspiciously like black magic to me.  If by "quick wiggle
to the right" you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right
before turning to the left, what is the input to the steering
mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old
"shove-shove"?
